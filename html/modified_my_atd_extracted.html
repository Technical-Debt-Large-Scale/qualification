in the software development process for short-term benefit, at the expense of
higher maintenance in the future. Every large software system contains Technical
Debt in some way or another, the di cult question is to know when, where, and
how to repay the debt.
To answer this we conducted three main steps. A literature study on how
to identify, measure, and manage Technical Debt (i), interviews (ii), and finding
key software metrics based on the Goal-Question-Metric paradigm to build a
Technical Debt Model with a visualisation dashboard (iii). This was used for
a case study at an organisation where files from two projects were analysed and
the model was evaluated by comparing the results with opinions from developers
who created the system.
The final model used 8 metrics as input and had a total success rate of 80%
when comparing the model’s ranking with mutual opinion of the developers.
The dashboard was seen to be a useful tool for discussion and a quick way
to identify areas in the code with Technical Debt. It was also discovered that
measuring Technical Debt with only software metrics is a hard to impossible task,
and many sources of information must be used in conjunction. To circumvent
this, an implementation model for the organisation using several information
channels together with the dashboard was created.</p><br><a href="https://lup.lub.lu.se/luur/download?func=downloadFile&recordOId=9066720&fileOId=9066721">link</a><br></div><div class="paper-info"><h2>Título 2: Architectural Technical Debt: Models and Impact</h2><h3>Autores: ['Antonio Martini']</h3><h4>Ano: 2014</h4><p>problem and motivation A known problem in large software companies is to balance the prioritization of short-term with long-term responsiveness. To illustrate such a phenomenon, a financial metaphor has been coined, which relates taking sub-optimal decisions in order to meet short-term goals to taking a financial debt, which has to be repaid with interests in the long term. Such a concept is referred to as Technical Debt (TD), and recently it has been recognized as a useful basis for the development of theoretical and practical frameworks (Kruchten et al., 2012). Tom et al. (Tom et al., 2013) have explored the TD metaphor and outlined a first framework in 2013. Part of the overall TD is to be related to architecture sub-optimal decisions, and it’s regarded as Architecture Technical Debt (ADT). ATD is regarded as violations in the code towards an intended architecture. The problem of visualizing and communicating the ATD is particularly relevant for large companies, where the architecture documentation is not capable of capturing all the updated information for compliance checking of the source code. It’s therefore difficult, both for software architects and managers not involved directly in the development of parts of the system, to monitor and understand the level of current ATD. This, in turn, affects negatively their ability of taking informed decision about the prioritization of architectural improvements and refactorings and about estimating the time needed for product development. ATD has been recognized as part of TD, but the specific phenomenon of accumulation of ATD, its recovery to avoid the later payment of interest (in terms of effort) and the impact (effects) of such interest in future development has not been tackled yet.</p><br><a href="http://laser.inf.ethz.ch/2014/students/martini.pdf">link</a><br></div><div class="paper-info"><h2>Título 3: An Empirical Study of the Extent and Causes of Technical Debt in Public Organizations Software Systems</h2><h3>Autores: ['Leonard Binamungu', 'Danford Phiri', 'Fatuma Simba']</h3><h4>Ano: 2022</h4><p>Because of short time to market for software systems, suboptimal design and implementation choices are sometimes made by software teams. Technical Debt (TD) is the term used to describe software quality flaws that are caused by time-saving shortcuts. Previous research has focused on the identification, causes, and management of TD. However, most of previous studies on TD have been informed by private and open source software projects, lacking insights from the public sector. Researchers have argued that software systems in the public sector are different from software systems in the private sector and open source projects, because organizations in the public sector are subjected to specific restrictions and requirements. Thus, TD causes, challenges, and the strategies to manage TD might differ between the public sector and the private sector and open source projects, which calls for the need to study TD in the public sector.To make a start in filling this gap, we studied 102 software systems and surveyed 73 practitioners from 13 public organizations in Tanzania, to understand the extent and causes of TD in the Tanzanian public sector. A substantial amount of TD was found in the studied systems. Architectural TD was the most accumulated type of TD, followed by Design TD and Code TD. Moreover, modularity violations and project management issues were found to be the leading causes of TD in software systems of the studied public organizations. We, thus, recommend the investigation of TD management strategies that are suitable for software systems in the public sector. From a public sector viewpoint, we contribute empirical insights to the literature on the extent, causes, and management of TD in software systems.</p><br><a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4040641">link</a><br></div><div class="paper-info"><h2>Título 4: Managing Technical Debt in XP Teams</h2><h3>Autores: ['Tilda Glas', "Filip Hed{\\'e}n"]</h3><h4>Ano: 0</h4><br><br><div class="paper-info"><h2>Título 5: Code Smells and Refactoring: A Tertiary Systematic Review of Challenges and Observations</h2><h3>Autores: ['Marcelo PImenta', 'Guilherme Lacerda']</h3><h4>Ano: 2020</h4><p>Refactoring and smells have been well researched by the software-engineering research community these past decades. Several secondary studies have been published on code smells, discussing their implications on software quality, their impact on maintenance and evolution, and existing tools for their detection. Other secondary studies addressed refactoring, discussing refactoring techniques, opportunities for refactoring, impact on quality, and tools support.

In this paper, we present a tertiary systematic literature review of previous surveys, secondary systematic literature reviews, and systematic mappings. We identify the main observations (what we know) and challenges (what we do not know) on code smells and refactoring. We perform this tertiary review using eight scientific databases, based on a set of five research questions, identifying 40 secondary studies between 1992 and 2018.

We organize the main observations and challenges about code smell and their refactoring into: smells definitions, most common code-smell detection approaches, code-smell detection tools, most common refactoring, and refactoring tools. We show that code smells and refactoring have a strong relationship with quality attributes, i.e., with understandability, maintainability, testability, complexity, functionality, and reusability. We argue that code smells and refactoring could be considered as the two faces of a same coin. Besides, we identify how refactoring affects quality attributes, more than code smells. We also discuss the implications of this work for practitioners, researchers, and instructors. We identify 13 open issues that could guide future research work.

Thus, we want to highlight the gap between code smells and refactoring in the current state of software-engineering research. We wish that this work could help the software-engineering research community in collaborating on future work on code smells and refactoring.

ATD concerns the overall structure and architecture of a softwareintensive system and can be described as the unresolved shortcuts developers take under circumstances of e.g. time pressure and uncertain requirements. Planning and constructing a well-thought-out architecture is time consuming and resource-intensive and if not done carefully, it can cause ATD. This thesis aims to investigate if it is possible to prevent the rise of ATD with a software project generator and how to maintain it. We have carried out a study following the design science research paradigm at a case company, Jayway by Devoteam. We conducted both literature and empirical studies to better understand the current situation at the case company and based on that proposed a feasible solution. According to our findings, a project generator tool can mitigate the causes of ATD at the beginning of a project. However, ATD can be introduced later on due to various factors, for instance negligence of best practices. Moreover, we concluded that the most suitable way for maintaining such a tool is adopting Inner Source.</p><br><br><div class="paper-info"><h2>Título 8: A Survey of Software Architectural Change Detection and Categorization Techniques</h2><h3>Autores: ['Amit Mondal', 'Kevin Schneider', 'Banani Roy', 'Chanchal Roy']</h3><h4>Ano: 0</h4><br><br><div class="paper-info"><h2>Título 9: The mythical man-month</h2><h3>Autores: ['Frederick Brooks']</h3><h4>Ano: 1974</h4><p>The more complex is a problem, it does not always put more people to help solve the problem.</p><br><a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.5555/207583">link</a><br></div><div class="paper-info"><h2>Título 10: Robust tests for heteroscedasticity based on regression quantiles</h2><h3>Autores: ['Roger Koenker', 'Gilbert Bassett Jr']</h3><h4>Ano: 1982</h4><br><br><div class="paper-info"><h2>Título 11: Influential observations, high leverage points, and outliers in linear regression</h2><h3>Autores: ['Samprit Chatterjee', 'Ali Hadi']</h3><h4>Ano: 1986</h4><br><br><div class="paper-info"><h2>Título 12: The WyCash Portfolio Management System</h2><h3>Autores: ['Ward Cunningham']</h3><h4>Ano: 1992</h4><br><br><div class="paper-info"><h2>Título 13: Foundations for the study of software architecture</h2><h3>Autores: ['Dewayne Perry', 'Alexander Wolf']</h3><h4>Ano: 1992</h4><p>The purpose of this paper is to build the foundation for software architecture. We first develop an intuition for software architecture by appealing to several well-established architectural disciplines. On the basis of this intuition, we present a model of software architecture that consists of three components: elements, form, and rationale. Elements are either processing, data, or connecting elements. Form is defined in terms of the properties of, and the relationships among, the elements --- that is, the constraints on the elements. The rationale provides the underlying basis for the architecture in terms of the system constraints, which most often derive from the system requirements. We discuss the components of the model in the context of both architectures and architectural styles and present an extended example to illustrate some important architecture and style considerations. We conclude by presenting some of the benefits of our approach to software architecture, summarizing our contributions, and relating our approach to other current work.</p><br><br><div class="paper-info"><h2>Título 14: A Metrics Suite for Object Oriented Design</h2><h3>Autores: ['S. Chidamber', 'C. Kemerer']</h3><h4>Ano: 1994</h4><p>Given the central role that software development plays in the delivery and application of information technology, managers are increasingly focusing on process improvement in the software development area. This demand has spurred the provision of a number of new and/or improved approaches to software development, with perhaps the most prominent being object-orientation (OO). In addition, the focus on process improvement has increased the demand for software measures, or metrics with which to manage the process. The need for such metrics is particularly acute when an organization is adopting a new technology for which established practices have yet to be developed. This research addresses these needs through the development and implementation of a new suite of metrics for OO design. Metrics developed in previous research, while contributing to the field's understanding of software development processes, have generally been subject to serious criticisms, including the lack of a theoretical base. Following Wand and Weber (1989), the theoretical base chosen for the metrics was the ontology of Bunge (1977). Six design metrics are developed, and then analytically evaluated against Weyuker's (1988) proposed set of measurement principles. An automated data collection tool was then developed and implemented to collect an empirical sample of these metrics at two field sites in order to demonstrate their feasibility and suggest ways in which managers may use these metrics for process improvement.</p><br><br><div class="paper-info"><h2>Título 15: Management of distributed concurrent development for large scale software systems</h2><h3>Autores: ['Mikio Aoyama']</h3><h4>Ano: 1995</h4><p>The article discusses a new software process model, distributed concurrent development, and its experience in developing a family of large-scale communication software systems. We have experienced an evolutionary change of our software development process. The change is spread into two dimensions, that is, from sequential to concurrent, and from centralized to distributed. With the concurrent development process model, multiple functions to a single software system are concurrently developed from the beginning of the development process, i.e. requirement specification, to system testing. In the distributed development process model, the development organization is decentralized into multiple development sites which are geographically distributed. The two dimensional changes require a fundamental re-think of our software process and brought about a significant impact on every aspect of software development activities ranging from individual developers to the entire project. We discuss the model, the issues in implementing the model, and our total system of managing the process, project and products.</p><br><br><div class="paper-info"><h2>Título 16: A validation of object-oriented design metrics as quality indicators</h2><h3>Autores: ['Victor Basili', 'Lionel Briand', "Walc{\\'e}lio Melo"]</h3><h4>Ano: 1996</h4><p>This paper presents the results of a study in which we empirically investigated the suite of object-oriented (OO) design metrics introduced in (Chidamber and Kemerer, 1994). More specifically, our goal is to assess these metrics as predictors of fault-prone classes and, therefore, determine whether they can be used as early quality indicators. This study is complementary to the work described in (Li and Henry, 1993) where the same suite of metrics had been used to assess frequencies of maintenance changes to classes. To perform our validation accurately, we collected data on the development of eight medium-sized information management systems based on identical requirements. All eight projects were developed using a sequential life cycle model, a well-known OO analysis/design method and the C++ programming language. Based on empirical and quantitative analysis, the advantages and drawbacks of these OO metrics are discussed. Several of Chidamber and Kemerer's OO metrics appear to be useful to predict class fault-proneness during the early phases of the life-cycle. Also, on our data set, they are better predictors than "traditional" code metrics, which can only be collected at a later phase of the software development processes.</p><br><br><div class="paper-info"><h2>Título 17: Laws of software evolution revisited</h2><h3>Autores: ['Manny Lehman']</h3><h4>Ano: 1996</h4><p>Data obtained during a 1968 study of the software process [8] led to an investigation of the evolution of OS/360 [13] and and, over a period of twenty years, to formulation of eight Laws of Software Evolution. The FEAST project recently initiated (see sections 4–6 below) is expected to throw additional light on the phenomenology underlying these laws, to increase understanding of them, to explore their finer detail, to expose their wider relevance and implications and to develop means for their beneficial exploitation. This paper is intended to trigger wider interest in the laws and in the FEAST study of feedback and feedback control in the context of the software process and its improvement to ensure beneficial exploitation of their potential</p><br><br><div class="paper-info"><h2>Título 18: Content analysis: concepts, methods and applications.</h2><h3>Autores: ['Stephen Cavanagh']</h3><h4>Ano: 1997</h4><br><br><div class="paper-info"><h2>Título 19: Effects of Process Maturity on Quality, Cycle Time, and Effort in Software Product Development</h2><h3>Autores: ['Donald Harter', 'Mayuram Krishnan', 'Sandra Slaughter']</h3><h4>Ano: 2000</h4><p>The information technology (IT) industry is characterized by rapid innovation and intense competition. To survive, IT firms must develop high quality software products on time and at low cost. A key issue is whether high levels of quality can be achieved without adversely impacting cycle time and effort. Conventional beliefs hold that processes to improve software quality can be implemented only at the expense of longer cycle times and greater development effort. However, an alternate view is that quality improvement, faster cycle time, and effort reduction can be simultaneously attained by reducing defects and rework. In this study, we empirically investigate the relationship between process maturity, quality, cycle time, and effort for the development of 30 software products by a major IT firm. We find that higher levels of process maturity as assessed by the Software Engineering Institute's Capability Maturity Model™ are associated with higher product quality, but also with increases in development effort. However, our findings indicate that the reductions in cycle time and effort due to improved quality outweigh the increases from achieving higher levels of process maturity. Thus, the net effect of process maturity is reduced cycle time and development effort.</p><br><br><div class="paper-info"><h2>Título 20: Tactical Approaches for Alleviating Distance in Global Software Development</h2><h3>Autores: ['E. Carmel', 'R. Agarwal']</h3><h4>Ano: 2001</h4><p>To overcome the problem of distance in global software development, various managers are experimenting and quickly adjusting their tactical approaches. We discuss some emerging approaches and explain their motivations from conceptual and practical perspectives. The most intuitive approach for alleviating distance is to apply communication technologies, but this is not our focus. Rather, we examine tactics that go beyond communication technologies, tactics aimed at reducing intensive collaboration, national and organizational cultural differences, and temporal distance.</p><br><br><div class="paper-info"><h2>Título 21: Software architecture in practice</h2><h3>Autores: ['Len Bass', 'Paul Clements', 'Rick Kazman']</h3><h4>Ano: 2003</h4><br><br><div class="paper-info"><h2>Título 22: An empirical study of speed and communication in globally distributed software development</h2><h3>Autores: ['J. Herbsleb', 'A. Mockus']</h3><h4>Ano: 2003</h4><p>Global software development is rapidly becoming the norm for technology companies. Previous qualitative research suggests that distributed development may increase development cycle time for individual work items (modification requests). We use both data from the source code change management system and survey data to model the extent of delay in a distributed software development organization and explore several possible mechanisms for this delay. One key finding is that distributed work items appear to take about two and one-half times as long to complete as similar items where all the work is colocated. The data strongly suggest a mechanism for the delay, i.e., that distributed work items involve more people than comparable same-site work items, and the number of people involved is strongly related to the calendar time to complete a work item. We replicate the analysis of change data in a different organization with a different product and different sites and confirm our main findings. We also report survey results showing differences between same-site and distributed social networks, testing several hypotheses about characteristics of distributed social networks that may be related to delay. We discuss implications of our findings for practices and collaboration technology that have the potential for dramatically speeding distributed software development.</p><br><br><div class="paper-info"><h2>Título 23: Systematic reviews and meta-analyses: an illustrated, step-by-step guide.</h2><h3>Autores: ['Madhukar Pai', 'Michael McCulloch', 'Jennifer Gorman', 'Nitika Pai', 'Wayne Enanoria', 'Gail Kennedy', 'Prathap Tharyan', 'Jr Colford']</h3><h4>Ano: 2004</h4><p>Systematic reviews and meta-analyses synthesize data from existing primary research, and well-conducted reviews offer clinicians a practical solution to the problem of staying current in their fields of interest. A whole generation of secondary journals, pre-appraised evidence libraries and periodically updated electronic texts are now available to clinicians. However, not all systematic reviews are of high quality, and it is important to be able to critically assess their validity and applicability. This article is an illustrated guide for conducting systematic reviews. A clear understanding of the process will provide clinicians with the tools to judiciously appraise reviews and interpret them. We hope that it will enable clinicians to conduct systematic reviews, generate high-quality evidence, and contribute to the evidence-based medicine movement.</p><br><br><div class="paper-info"><h2>Título 24: Refactoring to Patterns</h2><h3>Autores: ['Joshua Kerievsky']</h3><h4>Ano: 2004</h4><br><br><div class="paper-info"><h2>Título 25: Practical machine learning tools and techniques</h2><h3>Autores: ['Ian Witten', 'Eibe Frank', 'Mark Hall', 'Christopher Pal']</h3><h4>Ano: 2005</h4><br><br><div class="paper-info"><h2>Título 26: Requirements engineering paper classification and evaluation criteria: a proposal and a discussion</h2><h3>Autores: ['Roel Wieringa', 'Neil Maiden', 'Nancy Mead', 'Colette Rolland']</h3><h4>Ano: 2006</h4><p>In recent years, members of the steering committee of the IEEE Requirements Engineering (RE) Conference have discussed paper classification and evaluation criteria for RE papers. The immediate trigger for this discussion was our concern about differences in opinion that sometimes arise in program committees about the criteria to be used in evaluating papers. If program committee members do not all use the same criteria, or if they use criteria different from those used by authors, then papers might be rejected or accepted for the wrong reasons. Surely not all papers should be evaluated according to the same criteria. Some papers describe new techniques but do not report on empirical research; others describe new conceptual frameworks for investigating certain RE problems; others report on industrial experience with existing RE techniques. Other kinds of papers can also be easily recognized. All of these types of papers should be evaluated according to different criteria. But we are far from a consensus about what classes of paper we should distinguish, and what the criteria are for each of these classes. We see a variety of evaluation criteria in journals too. At one extreme is the set of nine genres used by IEEE Software [15], all of which have different evaluation criteria. At the other extreme is the single paper class recognized by the Requirements Engineering Journal, which has the following evaluation criteria: originality, utility, technical contribution, and relation to previous work. Apparently, the only paper class recognized by the Requirements Engineering Journal is a paper describing an original and useful solution technique. This corresponds to the “how to” genre of IEEE Software. This leaves authors and reviewers for the Requirements Engineering Journal in the dark about how other classes of papers should be judged, such as experience reports, empirical studies, or tutorials, none of which describe an original technique. This might lead to the use, by reviewers, of evaluation criteria unknown to authors, or even to the use of mutually inconsistent evaluation criteria by different reviewers of the same submission. The calls for papers of successive RE conferences, in which some of us acted as program chair, show an evolution of paper classification and evaluation schemes. Each scheme was based on the experience of the previous chair, and we tried to pass on our experience to the next chair. We also discussed our ideas with other members of the Steering Committee of the RE conferences, and with RE researchers outside the Steering Committee. This short note presents the outcome of those discussions in the form of a proposal for paper classification and a set of evaluation criteria for different paper classes. We hope to include more people in the discussion and thereby further improve the classification and evaluation scheme. In Section 2, we sketch the rationale for our classification. Section 3 presents the classification, and Section 4 concludes with a discussion of background ideas and related work.</p><br><br><div class="paper-info"><h2>Título 27: Uncovering the Reality Within Virtual Software Teams</h2><h3>Autores: ['Valentine Casey', 'Ita Richardson']</h3><h4>Ano: 2006</h4><p>To support software development globalisation, organisations are increasingly implementing virtual team strategies. However, these teams have to work within the confines of the factors which distance introduces, thus not always allowing effective coordination, visibility, communication and cooperation to take place. The successful implementation and management of such teams must be done differently to those at single-site locations. To establish what factors significantly affect the implementation of virtual teams, the authors carried out qualitative research in two organisations in Ireland. Results from this research demonstrate that many factors are reality for those involved in global software development. In this paper we present five of these factors and discuss the impact these had on the virtual teams. These five are: use of communication tools, project management, process engineering, technical ability and knowledge transfer and motivational issues. If these are not explicitly addressed by management it can lead to serious problems.</p><br><br><div class="paper-info"><h2>Título 28: Suitability of requirements prioritization methods for market-driven software product development</h2><h3>Autores: ['Laura Lehtola', 'Marjo Kauppinen']</h3><h4>Ano: 2006</h4><p>In a company producing off‐the‐shelf software for mass markets, the future development steps of the products cannot be negotiated with one or few customers. The decisions concerning the priorities of the requirements must be made within the company, the developer bearing all the financial risks included. This means that finding the right priorities for the requirements is important. However, requirements prioritization is recognized as a difficult activity in software product development. The literature offers methods for requirements prioritization, but many authors report that practices in companies are mostly informal. In this study, we evaluated two requirements prioritization methods in industrial product development projects. In the first case, the users of the system evaluated the pair‐wise comparison technique for prioritizing user needs. In the second case, practitioners evaluated Wiegers' method for change requests. In addition, we interviewed 11 practitioners from 6 companies about their current requirements prioritization practices and the models that they use as a basis of their prioritization decisions. Our findings indicate that prioritization methods may have limited ability to support decision‐making in a complex area like requirements prioritization in market‐driven product development. In addition, there are practical difficulties in the usage of methods, and therefore, prioritization results should be taken more as being indicative than as an ultimate truth.

Decisions made at the architectural level directly enable, facilitate, hamper, or interfere with the achievement of business goals, functional and quality requirements. Architecture evaluations play an important role in the development and evolution of software systems since they determine how adequate the architecture is for its intended usage. This paper summarizes our practical experience with using architecture evaluations and gives an overview on when and how static architecture evaluations contribute to architecture development. We identify ten distinct purposes and needs for static architecture evaluations and illustrate them using a set of industrial and academic case studies. In particular, we show how subsequent steps in architecture development are influenced by the results from architecture evaluations</p><br><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/1602379">link</a><br></div><div class="paper-info"><h2>Título 30: Do Gradations of Time Zone Separation Make a Difference in Performance? A First Laboratory Study</h2><h3>Autores: ['J. Espinosa', 'N. Nan', 'E. Carmel']</h3><h4>Ano: 2007</h4><p>We often hear that global software engineering teams are affected by time differences. While there is considerable research on the difficulties of distance, culture and other dimensions, there has been little research that isolated the impact of just time differences. The research question that guides us is whether there are gradual differences across time zones that impact team performance. In this study we conducted a laboratory experiment with 42 dyadic teams. The teams were randomly assigned into 4 time zone overlap conditions: full overlap, 2/3 overlap, 1/3 overlap and no overlap. Using a fictional map task, we found that participants' perceptions of process are unrelated to actual objective performance measures of speed and accuracy. Consistent with our expectations, we found that a small time separation has no effect on accuracy, but that more time separation has a significant effect on accuracy. Also consistent with our expectations, we found that a small amount of time separation has a significant effect on production speed. However, contrary to our expectations, we found that further increases in partial overlap have less significant effects on speed, and when there is no overlap speed actually increases, albeit not significantly - a "U-shaped" effect.</p><br><br><div class="paper-info"><h2>Título 31: Guidelines for performing systematic literature reviews in software engineering</h2><h3>Autores: ['Barbara Kitchenham', 'Stuart Charters']</h3><h4>Ano: 2007</h4><br><br><div class="paper-info"><h2>Título 32: Understanding Documentation Value in Software Maintenance</h2><h3>Autores: ['Sumita Das', 'Wayne Lutters', 'Carolyn Seaman']</h3><h4>Ano: 2007</h4><p>This study examines effective documentation use in software maintenance. Interviews with software maintainers, with diverse levels of experience, revealed three themes: reliance on source code, characteristics of useful documents, and the interplay between people in the maintenance environment and documentation. All of these findings improve our understanding of the role of documentation in maintenance. This awareness has practical import - project managers can fund the most useful forms of documentation and maintainers can improve their ability to locate and reuse this information.</p><br><br><div class="paper-info"><h2>Título 33: Systematic mapping studies in software engineering</h2><h3>Autores: ['Kai Petersen', 'Robert Feldt', 'Shahid Mujtaba', 'Michael Mattsson']</h3><h4>Ano: 2008</h4><p>BACKGROUND: A software engineering systematic map is a defined method to build a classification scheme and structure a software engineering field of interest. The analysis of results focuses on frequencies of publications for categories within the scheme. Thereby, the coverage of the research field can be determined. Different facets of the scheme can also be combined to answer more specific research questions. OBJECTIVE: We describe how to conduct a systematic mapping study in software engineering and provide guidelines. We also compare systematic maps and systematic reviews to clarify how to chose between them. This comparison leads to a set of guidelines for systematic maps. METHOD: We have defined a systematic mapping process and applied it to complete a systematic mapping study. Furthermore, we compare systematic maps with systematic reviews by systematically analyzing existing systematic reviews. RESULTS: We describe a process for software engineering systematic mapping studies and compare it to systematic reviews. Based on this, guidelines for conducting systematic maps are defined. CONCLUSIONS: Systematic maps and reviews are different in terms of goals, breadth, validity issues and implications. Thus, they should be used complementarily and require different methods (e.g., for analysis).</p><br><br><div class="paper-info"><h2>Título 34: The qualitative content analysis process</h2><h3>Autores: ['Satu Elo', 'Helvi Kyngas']</h3><h4>Ano: 2008</h4><p>Aim. This paper is a description of inductive and deductive content analysis. Background. Content analysis is a method that may be used with either qualitative or quantitative data and in an inductive or deductive way. Qualitative content analysis is commonly used in nursing studies but little has been published on the analysis process and many research books generally only provide a short description of this method. Discussion. When using content analysis, the aim was to build a model to describe the phenomenon in a conceptual form. Both inductive and deductive analysis processes are represented as three main phases: preparation, organizing and reporting. The preparation phase is similar in both approaches. The concepts are derived from the data in inductive content analysis. Deductive content analysis is used when the structure of analysis is operationalized on the basis of previous knowledge. Conclusion. Inductive content analysis is used in cases where there are no previous studies dealing with the phenomenon or when it is fragmented. A deductive approach is useful if the general aim was to test a previous theory in a different situation or to compare categories at different time periods.</p><br><br><div class="paper-info"><h2>Título 35: The road ahead for mining software repositories</h2><h3>Autores: ['Ahmed Hassan']</h3><h4>Ano: 2008</h4><p>Source control repositories, bug repositories, archived communications, deployment logs, and code repositories are examples of software repositories that are commonly available for most software projects. The mining software repositories (MSR) field analyzes and cross-links the rich data available in these repositories to uncover interesting and actionable information about software systems. By transforming these repositories from static record-keeping ones into active repositories, we can guide decision processes in modern software projects. For example, data in source control repositories, traditionally used to archive code, could be linked with data in bug repositories to help practitioners propagate complex changes and to warn them about risky code based on prior changes and bugs. In this paper, we present a brief history of the MSR field and discuss several recent achievements and results of using MSR techniques to support software research and practice. We then discuss the various opportunities and challenges that lie in the road ahead for this important and emerging field.</p><br><br><div class="paper-info"><h2>Título 36: Global Software Development: Where Are the Benefits?</h2><h3>Autores: ["E. Conch\\'{u}ir", 'P. {\\AA}gerfalk', 'H. Holmstrom', 'B. Fitzgerald']</h3><h4>Ano: 2009</h4><p>Global Software Development (GSD) is increasingly becoming the normal practice in the software industry, readily evidenced by U.S. estimates that the value of the offshore software development market has increased 25-fold over the past 10 years, to the extent that one-quarter of U.S. spending on application development, integration and management services is expected to go off-shore according to recent predictions. There are many potential benefits that can arise from GSD. The most frequently cited one is that of reduced development costs due to the salary savings possible. Also, GSD can lead to reduced development duration due to greater time zone effectiveness as companies practice the so-called 'follow-the-sun' software development model. GSD also affords new opportunities for cross-site modularization of development work, potential access to a larger and better-skilled developer pool, and the possibility of greater innovation, learning and transfer of best practices. Finally, GSD can facilitate closer proximity to markets and customers. However, GSD also introduces a number of challenges in relation to communication, coordination and control of the development process. These arise due to the distances involved in three dimensions -- geographical, temporal, and socio-cultural (See Figure 1). As a consequence, much research and practice has focused on trying to find ways to overcome the GSD challenges identified in Figure 1. In the literature to date, the potential benefits of GSD are usually just mentioned very briefly, if they are mentioned at all, and the realization of these benefits seems to be more or less taken for granted. The primary focus instead is on how the problems inherent in GSD might be addressed. Here, we reverse this trend and focus instead on the benefits and the extent to which they are actually being realized in practice in three global companies practicing GSD.</p><br><br><div class="paper-info"><h2>Título 37: Replicating msr: A study of the potential replicability of papers published in the mining software repositories proceedings</h2><h3>Autores: ['Gregorio Robles']</h3><h4>Ano: 2010</h4><p>This paper is the result of reviewing all papers published in the proceedings of the former International Workshop on Mining Software Repositories (MSR) (2004-2006) and now Working Conference on MSR (2007-2009). We have analyzed the papers that contained any experimental analysis of software projects for their potentiality of being replicated. In this regard, three main issues have been addressed: i) the public availability of the data used as case study, ii) the public availability of the processed dataset used by researchers and iii) the public availability of the tools and scripts. A total number of 171 papers have been analyzed from the six workshops/working conferences up to date. Results show that MSR authors use in general publicly available data sources, mainly from free software repositories, but that the amount of publicly available processed datasets is very low. Regarding tools and scripts, for a majority of papers we have not been able to find any tool, even for papers where the authors explicitly state that they have built one. Lessons learned from the experience of reviewing the whole MSR literature and some potential solutions to lower the barriers of replicability are finally presented and discussed.</p><br><br><div class="paper-info"><h2>Título 38: Transformation patterns for curing the human causes of technical debt</h2><h3>Autores: ['Jonathon Michael Golden']</h3><h4>Ano: 2010</h4><br><br><div class="paper-info"><h2>Título 39: Theoretical maximum capacity as benchmark for empty vehicle redistribution in personal rapid transit</h2><h3>Autores: ['John Lees-Miller', 'John Hammersley', 'R Wilson']</h3><h4>Ano: 2010</h4><br><br><div class="paper-info"><h2>Título 40: Infrastructure Debt: Revisiting the Foundation</h2><h3>Autores: ['Andrew Clay Shafer']</h3><h4>Ano: 2010</h4><br><br><div class="paper-info"><h2>Título 41: Managing technical debt in software-reliant systems</h2><h3>Autores: ['Nanette Brown', 'Yuanfang Cai', 'Yuepu Guo', 'Rick Kazman', 'Miryung Kim', 'Philippe Kruchten', 'Erin Lim', 'Alan MacCormack', 'Robert Nord', 'Ipek Ozkaya', 'others']</h3><h4>Ano: 2010</h4><p>Delivering increasingly complex software-reliant systems demands better ways to manage the long-term effects of short- term expedients. The technical debt metaphor is gaining significant traction in the agile development community as a way to understand and communicate such issues. The idea is that developers sometimes accept compromises in a system in one dimension (e.g., modularity) to meet an urgent demand in some other dimension (e.g., a deadline), and that such compromises incur a “debt”: on which “interest” has to be paid and which the “principal” should be repaid at some point for the long-term health of the project. We argue that the software engineering research community has an opportunity to study and improve this concept. We can offer software engineers a foundation for managing such trade-offs based on models of their economic impacts. Therefore, we propose managing technical debt as a part of the future research agenda for the software engineering field.</p><br><br><div class="paper-info"><h2>Título 42: Software architecture: foundations, theory, and practice</h2><h3>Autores: ['Nenad Medvidovic', 'Richard Taylor']</h3><h4>Ano: 2010</h4><p>Software architecture has become a centerpiece subject for software engineers, both researchers and practitioners alike. At the heart of every software system is its software architecture, i.e., "the set of principal design decisions about the system". Architecture permeates all major facets of a software system, for principal design decisions may potentially be made at any time during a system's lifetime, and potentially by any stakeholder. Such decisions encompass structural concerns, such as the system's high-level building blocks -components, connectors, and configurations; the system's deployment; the system's non-functional properties; and the system's evolution patterns, including runtime adaptation. Software architectures found particularly useful for families of systems - product lines - are often codified into architectural patterns, architectural styles, and reusable, parameterized reference architectures. This tutorial affords the participant an extensive treatment of the field of software architecture, its foundation, principles, and elements, including those mentioned above. Additionally, the tutorial introduces the participants to the state-of-the-art as well as the state-of-the-practice in software architecture, and looks at emerging and likely future trends in this field. The discussion is illustrated with numerous real-world examples. One example given prominent treatment is the architecture of the World Wide Web and its underlying architectural style, REpresentational State Transfer (REST).</p><br><br><div class="paper-info"><h2>Título 43: Multicollinearity</h2><h3>Autores: ['Aylin Alin']</h3><h4>Ano: 2010</h4><br><br><div class="paper-info"><h2>Título 44: A portfolio approach to technical debt management</h2><h3>Autores: ['Yuepu Guo', 'Carolyn Seaman']</h3><h4>Ano: 2011</h4><p>Technical debt describes the effect of immature software artifacts on software maintenance - the potential of extra effort required in future as if paying interest for the incurred debt. The uncertainty of interest payment further complicates the problem of what debt should be incurred or repaid and when. To help software managers make informed decisions, a portfolio approach is proposed in this paper. The approach leverages the portfolio management theory in the finance domain to determine the optimal collection of technical debt items that should be incurred or held. We expect this approach could provide a new perspective for technical debt management.</p><br><br><div class="paper-info"><h2>Título 45: Measuring and monitoring technical debt</h2><h3>Autores: ['Carolyn Seaman', 'Yuepu Guo']</h3><h4>Ano: 2011</h4><p>Technical debt is a metaphor for immature, incomplete, or inadequate artifacts in the software development lifecycle that cause higher costs and lower quality in the long run. These artifacts remaining in a system affect subsequent development and maintenance activities, and so can be seen as a type of debt that the system developers owe the system. Incurring technical debt may speed up software development in the short run, but such benefit is achieved at the cost of extra work in the future, as if paying interest on the debt. In this sense, the technical debt metaphor characterizes the relationship between the short-term benefits of delay- ing certain software maintenance tasks or doing them quickly and less carefully, and the long-term cost of those delays. However, managing technical debt is more complicated than managing financial debt because of the uncertainty involved. In this chapter, the authors review the main issues associated with technical debt, and propose a technical debt management framework and a research plan for validation. The objective of our research agenda is to develop and validate a comprehensive technical debt theory that formalizes the relationship between the cost and benefit sides of the concept. Further, we propose to use the theory to propose mechanisms (processes and tools) for measuring and managing technical debt in software product maintenance. The theory and management mechanisms are intended ultimately to contribute to the improved quality of software and facilitate decision making in software maintenance.</p><br><br><div class="paper-info"><h2>Título 46: An Enterprise Perspective on Technical Debt</h2><h3>Autores: ['Tim Klinger', 'Peri Tarr', 'Patrick Wagstrom', 'Clay Williams']</h3><h4>Ano: 2011</h4><p>Technical debt is a term that has been used to describe the increased cost of changing or maintaining a system due to expedient shortcuts taken during its development. Much of the research on technical debt has focused on decisions made by project architects and individual developers who choose to trade off short-term gain for a longer-term cost. However, in the context of enterprise software development, such a model may be too narrow. We explore the premise that technical debt within the enterprise should be viewed as a tool similar to financial leverage, allowing the organization to incur debt to pursue options that it couldn't otherwise afford. We test this premise by interviewing a set of experienced architects to understand how decisions to acquire technical debt are made within an enterprise, and to what extent the acquisition of technical debt provides leverage. We find that in many cases, the decision to acquire technical debt is not made by technical architects, but rather by non-technical stakeholders who cause the project to acquire new technical debt or discover existing technical debt that wasn't previously visible. We conclude with some preliminary observations and recommendations for organizations to better manage technical debt in the presence of some enterprise-scale circumstances.</p><br><br><div class="paper-info"><h2>Título 47: Using code analysis tools for architectural conformance checking</h2><h3>Autores: ['Jo Van Eyck', "Nelis Bouck{\\'e}", 'Alexander Helleboogh', 'Tom Holvoet']</h3><h4>Ano: 2011</h4><p>Architectural conformance checking verifies whether a system conforms to its intended architecture, which is essential to safeguard the quality attributes of the system. Due to the size of many systems, performing conformance checking by means of manual code inspections is often practically infeasible. Code analysis tools can be used to automatically check architectural conformance. In this paper, we investigate several code analysis tools that offer support for Java and compare them on their usefulness for architectural conformance checking: Architecture Rules, Macker, Lattix DSM, SonarJ, Structure101 and XDepend.</p><br><br><div class="paper-info"><h2>Título 48: Configuring Global Software Teams: A Multi-company Analysis of Project Productivity, Quality, and Profits</h2><h3>Autores: ['N.

Our analysis used data from 362 projects of four different firms. These projects spanned a wide range of programming languages, application domain, process choices, and development sites spread over 15 countries and 5 continents. Our analysis revealed fundamental tradeoffs in choosing configurational choices that are optimized for productivity, quality, and/or profits. In particular, achieving higher levels of productivity and quality require diametrically opposed configurational choices. In addition, creating imbalances in the expertise and personnel distribution of project teams significantly helps increase profit margins. However, a profit-oriented imbalance could also significantly affect productivity and/or quality outcomes. Analyzing these complex tradeoffs, we provide actionable managerial insights that can help software firms and their clients choose configurations that achieve desired project outcomes in globally distributed software development.</p><br><br><div class="paper-info"><h2>Título 49: In search of a metric for managing architectural technical debt</h2><h3>Autores: ['Robert Nord', 'Ipek Ozkaya', 'Philippe Kruchten', 'Marco Gonzalez-Rojas']</h3><h4>Ano: 2012</h4><p>Practices designed to expedite the delivery of stakeholder value can paradoxically lead to unexpected rework costs that ultimately degrade the flow of value over time. This is especially observable when features are developed based on immediate value, while dependencies that may slow down future development efforts are neglected. The technical debt metaphor conceptualizes this tradeoff between short-term and long-term value: taking shortcuts to optimize the delivery of features in the short term incurs debt, analogous to financial debt, that must be paid off later to optimize long-term success. In this paper, we describe taking an architecture-focused and measurement-based approach to develop a metric that assists in strategically managing technical debt. Such an approach can be used to optimize the cost of development over time while continuing to deliver value to the customer. We demonstrate our approach by describing its application to an ongoing system development effort.</p><br><br><div class="paper-info"><h2>Título 50: Global Software and IT</h2><h3>Autores: ['Christof Ebert']</h3><h4>Ano: 2012</h4><br><br><div class="paper-info"><h2>Título 51: Strategic management of technical debt: Tutorial synopsis</h2><h3>Autores: ['Philippe Kruchten']</h3><h4>Ano: 2012</h4><p>The technical debt metaphor acknowledges that software development teams sometimes accept compromises in a system in one dimension (for example, modularity) to meet an urgent demand in some other dimension (for example, a deadline), and that such compromises incur a "debt". If not properly managed the interest on this debt may continue to accrue, severely hampering system stability and quality and impacting the team's ability to deliver enhancements at a pace that satisfies business needs. Although unmanaged debt can have disastrous results, strategically managed debt can help businesses and organizations take advantage of time-sensitive opportunities, fulfill market needs and acquire stakeholder feedback. Because architecture has such leverage within the overall development life cycle, strategic management of architectural debt is of primary importance. Some aspects of technical debt - but not all technical debt - affects product quality.

From the original description—“not quite right code which we postpone making it right”1—various people have used the metaphor of technical “debt” to describe many other kinds of debts or ills of software development, encom- passing broadly anything that stands in the way of deploying, selling, or evolv- ing a software system or anything that adds to the friction from which soft- ware development endeavors suffer: test debt, people debt, architectural debt, requirement debt, documenta- tion debt, or just an amorphous, all- encompassing software debt.5 Conse- quently, the concept of technical debt. in software development has become somewhat diluted lately. Is a new re- quirement, function, or feature not yet implemented “requirement debt”? Do we call postponing the development of a new function “planning debt”?

While doing so, they make design tradeoffs to satisfy business needs such as meeting a release schedule. Technical debt is the result of such decisions or tradeoffs. When this happens, agile teams must pay off the accumulated debt by improving designs during subsequent iterations in order to improve maintainability. This must happen in a systematic way so that technical debt does not swell up and damage the project. Accomplishing this is one of the major challenges in distributed agile projects. The scope of technical debt in software projects is spread across all areas including architecture, design, code, and test scripts.</p><br><br><div class="paper-info"><h2>Título 59: An empirical investigation of changes in some software properties over time</h2><h3>Autores: ['Joseph Gil', 'Maayan Goldstein', 'Dany Moshkovich']</h3><h4>Ano: 2012</h4><p>Software metrics are easy to define, but not so easy to justify. It is hard to prove that a metric is valid, i.e., that measured numerical values imply anything on the vaguely defined, yet crucial software properties such as complexity and maintainability. This paper employs statistical analysis and tests to check some plausible assumptions on the behavior of software and metrics measured for this software in retrospective on its versions evolution history. Among those are the reliability assumption implicit in the application of any code metric, and the assumption that the magnitude of change, i.e., increase or decrease of its size, in a software artifact is correlated with changes to its version number. Putting a suite of 36 metrics to the trial, we confirm most of the assumptions on a large repository of software artifacts. Surprisingly, we show that a substantial portion of the reliability of some metrics can be observed even in random changes to architecture. Another surprising result is that Boolean-valued metrics tend to flip their values more often in minor software version increments than in major increments.</p><br><br><div class="paper-info"><h2>Título 60: Case Study Research in Software Engineering: Guidelines and Examples</h2><h3>Autores: ['P.

The absence of a clear definition and model for technical debt exacerbates the challenge of its identification and adequate management, thus preventing the realisation of technical debt's utility as a conceptual and technical communication device. Objective To make a critical examination of technical debt and consolidate understanding of the nature of technical debt and its implications for software development. Method An exploratory case study technique that involves multivocal literature review, supplemented by interviews with software practitioners and academics to establish the boundaries of the technical debt phenomenon. Result A key outcome of this research is the creation of a theoretical framework that provides a holistic view of technical debt comprising a set of technical debts dimensions, attributes, precedents and outcomes, as well as the phenomenon itself and a taxonomy that describes and encompasses different forms of the technical debt phenomenon. Conclusion The proposed framework provides a useful approach to understanding the overall phenomenon of technical debt for practical purposes.

As the community continues to broaden its scope and deepens its expertise, it is worthwhile to reflect on the best practices that our community has developed over the past decade of research. We identify these best practices by surveying past MSR conferences and workshops. To that end, we review all 117 full papers published in the MSR proceedings between 2004 and 2012. We extract 268 comments from these papers, and categorize them using a grounded theory methodology. From this evaluation, four high-level themes were identified: data acquisition and preparation, synthesis, analysis, and sharing/replication. Within each theme we identify several common recommendations, and also examine how these recommendations have evolved over the past decade. In an effort to make this survey a living artifact, we also provide a public forum that contains the extracted recommendations in the hopes that the MSR community can engage in a continuing discussion on our evolving best practices.</p><br><br><div class="paper-info"><h2>Título 64: What is social debt in software engineering?</h2><h3>Autores: ['Damian Tamburri', 'Philippe Kruchten', 'Patricia Lago', 'Hans Vliet']</h3><h4>Ano: 2013</h4><p>“Social debt” in software engineering informally refers to unforeseen project cost connected to a “suboptimal” development community. The causes of suboptimal development communities can be many, ranging from global distance to organisational barriers to wrong or uninformed socio-technical decisions (i.e., decisions that influence both social and technical aspects of software development). Much like technical debt, social debt impacts heavily on software development success. We argue that, to ensure quality software engineering, practitioners should be provided with mechanisms to detect and manage the social debt connected to their development communities. This paper defines and elaborates on social debt, pointing out relevant research paths. We illustrate social debt by comparison with technical debt and discuss common real-life scenarios that exhibit “sub-optimal” development communities.</p><br><br><div class="paper-info"><h2>Título 65: SonarQube in action</h2><h3>Autores: ['G Campbell', 'Patroklos Papapetrou']</h3><h4>Ano: 2013</h4><br><br><div class="paper-info"><h2>Título 66: Practical Considerations, Challenges, and Requirements of Tool-support for Managing Technical Debt</h2><h3>Autores: ['Davide Falessi', 'Michele Shaw', 'Forrest Shull', 'Kathleen Mullen', 'Mark Stein']</h3><h4>Ano: 2013</h4><p>Developing a software product with a high level of quality that also meets budget and schedule is the main goal of any organization.

The research community lacks rigorously evaluated guidelines to help practitioners characterize, manage and prioritize debt. This paper describes a study conducted with an industrial partner during their implementation of Agile development practices for a large software development division within the company. The report contains our initial findings based on ethnographic observations and semi-structured interviews. The goal is to identify the best practices regarding managing technical debt so that the researchers and the practitioners can further evaluate these practices to extend their knowledge of the technical debt metaphor. We determined that the developers considered their own taxonomy of technical debt based on the type of work they were assigned and their personal understanding of the term. Despite management's high-level categories, the developers mostly considered design debt, testing debt and defect debt. In addition to developers having their own taxonomy, assigning dedicated teams for technical debt reduction and allowing other teams about 20% of time per sprint for debt reduction are good initiatives towards lowering technical debt.

These processes are often intertwined and the same modules in the code become the locus of both drift and erosion symptoms. Thus, architects should elaborate architecture rules for detecting occur-rences of both degradation symptoms. While the specification of such rules is time-consuming, they are similar across software projects adhering to similar architecture decompositions. Unfortu-nately, existing anti-degradation techniques are limited as they focus only on detecting either drift or erosion symptoms. They also do not support the reuse of recurring anti-degradation rules. In this context, the contribution of this paper is twofold. First, it presents TamDera, a domain-specific language for: (i) specifying rule-based strategies to detect both erosion and drift symptoms, and (ii) promoting the hierarchical and compositional reuse of design rules across multiple projects. The language was designed with usual concepts from programming languages in mind such as, inheritance and modularization. Second, we evaluated to what extent developers would benefit from the definition and reuse of hybrid rules. Our study involved 21 versions pertaining to 5 software projects, and more than 600 rules. On average 45% of classes that had drift symptoms in first versions presented inter-related erosion problems in latter versions or vice-versa. Also, up to 72% of all the TamDera rules in a project are from a pre-defined library of reusable rules. They were responsible for detecting on average of 73% of the inter-related degradation symptoms across the projects.</p><br><br><div class="paper-info"><h2>Título 70: Titan: A toolset that connects software architecture with quality analysis</h2><h3>Autores: ['Lu Xiao', 'Yuanfang Cai', 'Rick Kazman']</h3><h4>Ano: 2014</h4><p>In this tool demo, we will illustrate our tool---Titan---that supports a new architecture model: design rule spaces (DRSpaces).

In this paper, we show that up to 38.9% of the files in open source systems have an incomplete history, and we propose an incremental, commit-based approach to reconstruct the history based on clone information and name similarity. With this approach, the history of a file can be reconstructed across repository boundaries and thus provides accurate information for any source code analysis.

Both of these characteristics cause accumulation of technical debt, something that is the end result of either intentional or unintentional decisions. The ability of these methods to function with technical debt indicates that they contain components with inherent technical debt management capabilities. This study conducts a survey on industry practitioners to discover what is their level of technical debt knowledge, how does technical debt manifest in their projects and which of the applied components of agile software development -- both processes and practices -- are sensitive to technical debt. This paper contributes to the technical debt discussion by showing differences in assumed and indicated technical debt knowledge. Furthermore, components closest to implementation and its maintenance are perceived to have the most positive effects on technical debt management. Finally, the most encountered instances of technical debt are caused by architectural inadequacies, they are internal legacy, and increase in size as a result of continued implementation.</p><br><br><div class="paper-info"><h2>Título 73: An exploratory study on self-admitted technical debt</h2><h3>Autores: ['Aniket Potdar', 'Emad Shihab']</h3><h4>Ano: 2014</h4><p>Throughout a software development life cycle, developers knowingly commit code that is either incomplete, requires rework, produces errors, or is a temporary workaround. Such incomplete or temporary workarounds are commonly referred to as 'technical debt'. Our experience indicates that self-admitted technical debt is common in software projects and may negatively impact software maintenance, however, to date very little is known about them. Therefore, in this paper, we use source-code comments in four large open source software projects-Eclipse, Chromium OS, Apache HTTP Server, and ArgoUML to identify self-admitted technical debt. Using the identified technical debt, we study 1) the amount of self-admitted technical debt found in these projects, 2) why this self-admitted technical debt was introduced into the software projects and 3) how likely is the self-admitted technical debt to be removed after their introduction. We find that the amount of self-admitted technical debt exists in 2.4%-31% of the files. Furthermore, we find that developers with higher experience tend to introduce most of the self-admitted technical debt and that time pressures and complexity of the code do not correlate with the amount of self-admitted technical debt. Lastly, although self-admitted technical debt is meant to be addressed or removed in the future, only between 26.3%-63.5% of self-admitted technical debt gets removed from projects after introduction.</p><br><br><div class="paper-info"><h2>Título 74: Architecture technical debt: Understanding causes and a qualitative model</h2><h3>Autores: ['Antonio Martini', 'Jan Bosch', 'Michel Chaudron']</h3><h4>Ano: 2014</h4><p>A known problem in large software companies is to balance the prioritization of short-term with long-term responsiveness.

We exploit Binomial Options to the formulation. We quantify the time-value of the architecture decisions of switching web services and technical debt they can imply on the structure. As CB-SOA are market-sensitive, dynamic and volatile, the decision of deferral tends to be sensitive to these dynamics. Henceforth, the structural complexity of a CB-SOAcan change over time and so the technical debt as its constituent web services are modified, replaced, upgraded, etc. The method builds on Design Structure Matrix (DSM) and introduces time and complexity aware propagation cost metrics to assess the value of deferral decisions relative to changes in the structure. Architects of CB-SOA can use our method to assess the time value of deferring the decisions to switch web services relative to complexity, technical debt and value creation. We demonstrate the applicability of the method using an illustrative example.</p><br><br><div class="paper-info"><h2>Título 76: An empirical investigation of modularity metrics for indicating architectural technical debt</h2><h3>Autores: ['Zengyang Li', 'Peng Liang', 'Paris Avgeriou', 'Nicolas Guelfi', 'Apostolos Ampatzoglou']</h3><h4>Ano: 2014</h4><p>Architectural technical debt (ATD) is incurred by design decisions that consciously or unconsciously compromise system-wide quality attributes, particularly maintainability and evolvability. ATD needs to be identified and measured, so that it can be monitored and eventually repaid, when appropriate. In practice, ATD is difficult to identify and measure, since ATD does not yield observable behaviors to end users. One indicator of ATD, is the average number of modified components per commit (ANMCC): a higher ANMCC indicates more ATD in a software system. However, it is difficult and sometimes impossible to calculate ANMCC, because the data (i.e., the log of commits) are not always available. In this work, we propose to use software modularity metrics, which can be directly calculated based on source code, as a substitute of ANMCC to indicate ATD. We validate the correlation between ANMCC and modularity metrics through a holistic multiple case study on thirteen open source software projects. The results of this study suggest that two modularity metrics, namely Index of Package Changing Impact (IPCI) and Index of Package Goal Focus (IPGF), have significant correlation with ANMCC, and therefore can be used as alternative ATD indicators.</p><br><a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2602576.2602581">link</a><br></div><div class="paper-info"><h2>Título 77: Qualitative content analysis: theoretical foundation, basic procedures and software solution</h2><h3>Autores: ['Philipp Mayring']</h3><h4>Ano: 2014</h4><br><br><div class="paper-info"><h2>Título 78: Architectural debt management in value-oriented architecting</h2><h3>Autores: ['Zengyang Li', 'Peng Liang', 'Paris Avgeriou']</h3><h4>Ano: 2014</h4><p>Architectural technical debt (ATD) may be incurred when making architecture decisions.

A universal defect prediction model that is built from the entire set of diverse projects would relieve the need for building models for an individual project. A universal model could also be interpreted as a basic relationship between software metrics and defects. However, the variations in the distribution of predictors pose a formidable obstacle to build a universal model. Such variations exist among projects with different context factors (e.g., size and programming language). To overcome this challenge, we propose context-aware rank transformations for predictors. We cluster projects based on the similarity of the distribution of 26 predictors, and derive the rank transformations using quantiles of predictors for a cluster. We then fit the universal model on the transformed data of 1,398 open source projects hosted on SourceForge and GoogleCode. Adding context factors to the universal model improves the predictive power. The universal model obtains prediction performance comparable to the within-project models and yields similar results when applied on five external projects (one Apache and four Eclipse projects). These results suggest that a universal defect prediction model may be an achievable goal.</p><br><br><div class="paper-info"><h2>Título 80: Applicability of technical debt as a concept to understand obstacles for evolution of automated production systems</h2><h3>Autores: ['Birgit Vogel-Heuser', 'Susanne R{\\"o}sch']</h3><h4>Ano: 2015</h4><p>Automated production systems (aPS), a specific class of mechatronic systems, are complex, long living, software intensive, evolving systems designed according to customer request. Often, the evolution of such systems has to cope with imponderables and sudden disturbances of the systematic development or maintenance process. In software engineering, the concept of technical debt and, in more detail, architectural technical debt has been introduced recently to describe phenomena, which increase software development costs over time. This paper tries to adapt and apply the classification of technical debt and architectural technical debt to automated production systems, identifying similar dimensions but adding specific challenges, causes and their effects. Once the causes and effects are identified, management and recovery strategies coping with technical debt and architectural technical debt shall be developed in the future, thereby enlarging the strategies from software engineering.

ATD is harmful to the system's long-term health, thus it needs to be identified for further management. However, existing ATD identification approaches are mainly based on source code analysis and thus suffer from certain shortcomings: they can only identify issues at the system implementation, they can only be employed after the systems is implemented in code, they lack a mechanism to confirm whether the potential ATD identified is real ATD or not. To address these issues, we proposed an ATD identification approach based on architecture decisions and change scenarios. To evaluate the effectiveness and usability of this approach, we conducted a case study with an information system in a large telecommunications company.

Unmanaged technical debt, especially architectural technical debt, can lead to additional development overhead and expensive refactoring. However, most research that address architectural technical debt does so by analyzing source code; very little research focus on a more abstract level. The problem with analyzing source code to identify debt is that it is not enough to cover all debt. Similarly, most visualisation of software architecture target lower level artifacts based on static code analysis. Therefore there is a gap in both addressing architectural technical debt and software visualisation on a more abstract level. By utilizing a case study at a company, followed by design research, we contribute to filling this gap by identifying, measuring, and visualizing architectural debt on a higher abstraction level.

Specifically, Architecture Technical Debt is regarded as sub-optimal architectural solutions taken to deliver fast that might hinder future feature development, which, in turn, would hinder agility. Objective This paper aims at improving software management by shedding light on the current factors responsible for the accumulation of Architectural Technical Debt and to understand how it evolves over time. Method We conducted an exploratory multiple-case embedded case study in 7 sites at 5 large companies. We evaluated the results with additional cross-company interviews and an in-depth, company-specific case study in which we initially evaluate factors and models. Results We compiled a taxonomy of the factors and their influence in the accumulation of Architectural Technical Debt, and we provide two qualitative models of how the debt is accumulated and refactored over time in the studied companies. We also list a set of exploratory propositions on possible refactoring strategies that can be useful as insights for practitioners and as hypotheses for further research. Conclusion Several factors cause constant and unavoidable accumulation of Architecture Technical Debt, which leads to development crises. Refactorings are often overlooked in prioritization and they are often triggered by development crises, in a reactive fashion. Some of the factors are manageable, while others are external to the companies. ATD needs to be made visible, in order to postpone the crises according to the strategic goals of the companies.

Based on its inter-disciplinary nature, i.e. software engineering and economics, research on managing technical debt should be balanced between software engineering and economic theories. Objective The aim of this study is to analyze research efforts on technical debt, by focusing on their financial aspect. Specifically, the analysis is carried out with respect to: (a) how financial aspects are defined in the context of technical debt and (b) how they relate to the underlying software engineering concepts. Method In order to achieve the abovementioned goals, we employed a standard method for SLRs and applied it on studies retrieved from seven general-scope digital libraries. In total we selected 69 studies relevant to the financial aspect of technical debt. Results The most common financial terms that are used in technical debt research are principal and interest, whereas the financial approaches that have been more frequently applied for managing technical debt are real options, portfolio management, cost/benefit analysis and value-based analysis. However, the application of such approaches lacks consistency, i.e., the same approach is differently applied in different studies, and in some cases lacks a clear mapping between financial and software engineering concepts. Conclusion The results are expected to prove beneficial for the communication between technical managers and project managers, in the sense that they will provide a common vocabulary, and will help in setting up quality-related goals, during software development. To achieve this we introduce: (a) a glossary of terms and (b) a classification scheme for financial approaches used for managing technical debt.

Studies show that this process is often not automated and that developers still rely heavily on manual reviews, despite the availability of a large number of tools. This is partially due to the high cost involved in setting up and maintaining tool-specific and incompatible test specifications that replicate otherwise documented invariants. To reduce this cost, our approach consists in unifying the functionality provided by existing tools under the umbrella of a common business-readable DSL. By using a declarative language, we are able to write tool-agnostic rules that are simple enough to be understood by untrained stakeholders and, at the same time, can be interpreted as a rigorous specification for checking architecture conformance.</p><br><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7158502">link</a><br></div><div class="paper-info"><h2>Título 88: A Case Study in Locating the Architectural Roots of Technical Debt</h2><h3>Autores: ['Rick Kazman', 'Yuanfang Cai', 'Ran Mo', 'Qiong Feng', 'Lu Xiao', 'Serge Haziyev', 'Volodymyr Fedak', 'Andriy Shapochka']</h3><h4>Ano: 2015</h4><p>Our recent research has shown that, in large-scale software systems, defective files seldom exist alone. They are usually architecturally connected, and their architectural structures exhibit significant design flaws which propagate bugginess among files. We call these flawed structures the architecture roots, a type of technical debt that incurs high maintenance penalties. Removing the architecture roots of bugginess requires refactoring, but the benefits of refactoring have historically been difficult for architects to quantify or justify. In this paper, we present a case study of identifying and quantifying such architecture debts in a large-scale industrial software project. Our approach is to model and analyze software architecture as a set of design rule spaces (DRSpaces). Using data extracted from the project's development artifacts, we were able to identify the files implicated in architecture flaws and suggest refactorings based on removing these flaws. Then we built economic models of the before and (predicted) after states, which gave the organization confidence that doing the refactorings made business sense, in terms of a handsome return on investment.</p><br><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7202962?casa_token=w1W7TngUVEwAAAAA:IGSZX-GRrnTHYntHSYHjmFIRHushUMj01Ql_Yu2HdLv99MepvL6CnL2IMNlN-8cUl0pUqcOn4Kuy">link</a><br></div><div class="paper-info"><h2>Título 89: Research Methods: The Essential Knowledge Base</h2><h3>Autores: ['W.

Incurring technical debt may bring short-term benefits to a project, but such benefits are often achieved at the cost of extra work in future, analogous to paying interest on the debt. Currently technical debt is managed implicitly, if at all. However, on large systems, it is too easy to lose track of delayed tasks or to misunderstand their impact. Therefore, we have proposed a new approach to managing technical debt, which we believe to be helpful for software managers to make informed decisions. In this study we explored the costs of the new approach by tracking the technical debt management activities in an on-going software project. The results from the study provided insights into the impact of technical debt management on software projects. In particular, we found that there is a significant start-up cost when beginning to track and monitor technical debt, but the cost of ongoing management soon declines to very reasonable levels. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.</p><br><a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10664-014-9351-7">link</a><br></div><div class="paper-info"><h2>Título 100: Identification of architectural technical debt: An analysis based on naming patterns</h2><h3>Autores: ['Paul Carpio']</h3><h4>Ano: 2016</h4><p>Hasty software development can produce immediate implementations with source code unnecessarily complex and hardly readable.

However, we currently lack an overview of how practitioners from this application domain perceive technical debt. To this end, we conducted a multiple case study in the embedded systems industry, to investigate: (a) the expected life-time of components that have TD, (b) the most frequently occurring types of TD in them, and (c) the significance of TD against run-time quality attributes. The case study was performed on seven embedded systems industries (telecommunications, printing, smart manufacturing, sensors, etc.) from five countries (Greece, Netherlands, Sweden, Austria, and Finland). The results of the case study suggest that: (a) maintainability is more seriously considered when the expected lifetime of components is larger than ten years, (b) the most frequent types of debt are test, architectural, and code debt, and (c) in embedded systems the run-time qualities are prioritized compared to design-time qualities that are usually associated with TD. The obtained results can be useful for both researchers and practitioners: the former can focus their research on the most industrially-relevant aspects of TD, whereas the latter can be informed about the most common types of TD and how to focus their TDM processes. © 2016 IEEE.</p><br><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7776447?casa_token=SVMpYCNczlQAAAAA:efB7hd7tiG98S73RS7NZ4i8IbpKCUldOo7I4LJR5ggbLszcT0sKZgH0018WTsljCXBmwW5qFOQ-B">link</a><br></div><div class="paper-info"><h2>Título 102: Identification and management of technical debt: A systematic mapping study</h2><h3>Autores: ['Nicolli Alves', 'Thiago Mendes', 'Manoel Mendon{\\c{c}}a', "Rodrigo Sp{\\'\\i}nola", 'Forrest Shull', 'Carolyn Seaman']</h3><h4>Ano: 2016</h4><p>Context: The technical debt metaphor describes the effect of immature artifacts on software maintenance that bring a short-term benefit to the project in terms of increased productivity and lower cost, but that may have to be paid off with interest later. Much research has been performed to propose mechanisms to identify debt and decide the most appropriate moment to pay it off. It is important to investigate the current state of the art in order to provide both researchers and practitioners with information that enables further research activities as well as technical debt management in practice. Objective: This paper has the following goals: to characterize the types of technical debt, identify indica- tors that can be used to find technical debt, identify management strategies, understand the maturity level of each proposal, and identify what visualization techniques have been proposed to support technical debt identification and management activities. Method: A systematic mapping study was performed based on a set of three research questions. In total, 100 studies, dated from 2010 to 2014, were evaluated. Results: We proposed an initial taxonomy of technical debt types, created a list of indicators that have been proposed to identify technical debt, identified the existing management strategies, and analyzed the current state of art on technical debt, identifying topics where new research efforts can be invested. Conclusion: The results of this mapping study can help to identify points that still require further investigation in technical debt research.</p><br><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0950584915001743?casa_token=gElvEMGvAm4AAAAA:AV2QbHn7FuKXKr6CABmCAUy0bzp5npV5edrZQDyGj9PdR1_1rWN4W7H_lCr0zfxhOhZRaUQyt8IC">link</a><br></div><div class="paper-info"><h2>Título 103: How do software development teams manage technical debt? An empirical study</h2><h3>Autores: ['J. Yli-Huumo', 'A. Maglyas', 'K. Smolander']</h3><h4>Ano: 2016</h4><p>Technical debt (TD) is a metaphor for taking shortcuts or workarounds in technical decisions to gain short-term benefit in time-to-market and earlier software release. In this study, one large software development organization is investigated to gather empirical evidence related to the concept of technical debt management (TDM). We used the exploratory case study method to collect and analyze empirical data in the case organization by interviewing a total of 25 persons in eight software development teams. We were able to identify teams where the current strategy for TDM was only to fix TD when necessary, when it started to cause too much trouble for development. We also identified teams where the management had a systematic strategy to identify, measure and monitor TD during the development process. It seems that TDM can be associated with a similar maturity concept as software development in general. Development teams may raise their maturity by increasing their awareness and applying more advanced processes, techniques and tools in TDM. TDM is an essential part of sustainable software development, and companies have to find right approaches to deal with TD to produce healthy software that can be developed and maintained in the future. © 2016 The Authors</p><br><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016412121630053X">link</a><br></div><div class="paper-info"><h2>Título 104: Architecture viewpoints for documenting architectural technical debt</h2><h3>Autores: ['Zengyang Li', 'Peng Liang', 'Paris Avgeriou']</h3><h4>Ano: 2016</h4><p>Technical debt (TD) has attracted an increasing interest from researchers and practitioners in the software engineering domain. Currently, most approaches to managing TD focus on dealing with TD at source code level, while few methods deal with TD at architecture level. If architectural technical debt (ATD) is not effectively managed in the architecting process, the knowledge about ATD is not made available to involved stakeholders and the impact of ATD is not considered during architecture decision-making. Thus, the system’s maintainability and evolvability can be intentionally or unintentionally compromised. As a result, architectures are costly to maintain and new features are difficult to introduce. To facilitate the management of ATD, it needs to be documented so that it becomes explicit to stakeholders. To this end, we propose a set of architecture viewpoints related to ATD (ATD viewpoints in short). Each viewpoint frames a number of concerns related to ATD. These ATD viewpoints together help to get a comprehensive understanding of ATD in a software system, thereby providing support for architecture decision-making. To evaluate the effectiveness of the ATD viewpoints in documenting ATD, we conducted a case study in a large telecommunications company. The results of this case study show that the documented ATD views can effectively facilitate the documentation of ATD. Specifically, the ATD viewpoints are relatively easy to understand; it takes an acceptable amount of effort to document ATD using the ATD viewpoints; and the documented ATD views are useful for stakeholders to understand the ATD in the software project.</p><br><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128023013000053">link</a><br></div><div class="paper-info"><h2>Título 105: A Decision Framework on Refactoring Architectural Technical Debt: Paying Back in Modularity-An Industrial Case Study</h2><h3>Autores: ['Erik Sikander', 'Neil Madlani']</h3><h4>Ano: 2016</h4><p>Technical debt refers to sub-optimal solutions during software development where there is a trade-o between short-term and long-term goals. Lately there has been a few studies which identi es technical debt, however most of the do not estimate the interest which is associated with the identi ed debt. Knowing how much interest is being paid allows the developers to make informed decisions of what will bene t the development. One example is knowing if a onetime cost of a repaying the debt outweighs the cost of paying the interest of that debt. This would mean that the repayment can be seen as an investment for future development. This thesis aims to develop a decision framework that can be used when deciding if part of a component would bene t from being modularized into a new component or framework to repay a debt. To accomplish this, the study developed two methods that are used by the decision framework. The rst method is to nd out if the analysed part of the components would bene t from such a modularization. The second method estimates how much e ort can be saved by doing a modularization. It was found that for the rst method, a measurement system which analysed the component's source code was a good approach in deciding if a modularization would be bene cial. For the second method an approach which used data regarding the current e ort distribution to estimate the e ort saved by modularizing was chosen. The result of combining the two methods was found to be an adequate decision framework which provides useful information in the decision if to modularize part of a component or not.</p><br><a href="https://gupea.ub.gu.se/handle/2077/42003">link</a><br></div><div class="paper-info"><h2>Título 106: Estimating and quantifying the benefits of refactoring to improve a component modularity: a case study</h2><h3>Autores: ['Antonio Martini', 'Erik Sikander', 'Niel Medlani']</h3><h4>Ano: 2016</h4><p>In recent years, research and industry's attention has been focused on maintaining a system that would both decrease time to market in the short term and assure a sustainable feature output and smooth maintenance operations in the long run. A related phenomenon has been identified in Architectural Technical Debt: if the system architecture is sub-optimal for long-term business goals, it needs to be refactored. A key property of the system assuring long-term goals consists on modularity, or else the ability to decouple different components: such property allows the product to be evolved without costly changes pervading the whole system. However, understanding the business benefits of refactoring to achieve modularity is not trivial, especially for large refactorings involving substantial architectural changes. We have conducted a case study in a large company, analyzing a case of refactoring a component to achieve modularity. We report a comparative study of a refactored against a non-refactored component. We found that the modularization would be repaid in several months of development and maintenance. We present a method to calculate the effort saved by the modularization and an equation for calculating and quantifying the development and maintenance benefits of refactoring.</p><br><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7592783?casa_token=ZRofKHprp3oAAAAA:Fo_VbPe6XOKTnwDnO433ibXivi4EXeJKbhv6TRiUGhZxzYhEGcpiF5Au5mFkquomHv0qhSqELglz">link</a><br></div><div class="paper-info"><h2>Título 107: Technical debt and system architecture: The impact of coupling on defect-related activity</h2><h3>Autores: ['Alan MacCormack', 'Daniel Sturtevant']</h3><h4>Ano: 2016</h4><p>Technical Debt is created when design decisions that are expedient in the short term increase the costs of maintaining and adapting this system in future. An important component of technical debt relates to decisions about system architecture. As systems grow and evolve, their architectures can degrade, increasing maintenance costs and reducing developer productivity. This raises the question if and when it might be appropriate to redesign (“refactor”) a system, to reduce what has been called “architectural debt”. Unfortunately, we lack robust data by which to evaluate the relationship between architectural design choices and system maintenance costs, and hence to predict the value that might be released through such refactoring efforts. We address this gap by analyzing the relationship between system architecture and maintenance costs for two software systems of similar size, but with very different structures; one has a “Hierarchical” design, the other has a “Core-Periphery” design. We measure the level of system coupling for the 20,000+ components in each system, and use these measures to predict maintenance efforts, or “defect-related activity.” We show that in both systems, the tightly-coupled Core or Central components cost significantly more to maintain then loosely-coupled Peripheral components. In essence, a small number of components generate a large proportion of system costs. However, we find major differences in the potential benefits available from refactoring these systems, related to their differing designs. Our results generate insight into how architectural debt can be assessed by understanding patterns of coupling among components in a system.</p><br><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0164121216300760?casa_token=VuPIXPszmQ8AAAAA:QGg4QvT2yEnI91peFexqFKg6RFr_JgG-6LlQw_XCz5FuhQ743ue46ApE6ntNt9tTtENDwRMGueBh">link</a><br></div><div class="paper-info"><h2>Título 108: Technical debt indexes provided by tools: a preliminary discussion</h2><h3>Autores: ['Francesca Fontana', 'Riccardo Roveda', 'Marco Zanoni']</h3><h4>Ano: 2016</h4><p>In software maintenance and evolution, it is important to assess both code and architecture in order to identify issues to be solved to improve software quality.

However, decisions on if and when to refactor architecture are extremely important and difficult to take, since changing software at the architectural level is quite expensive. Therefore it is important, for software organizations, to have methods and tools that aid architects and managers to understand if Architecture Technical Debt will generate a costly and growing interest to be paid or not. Current knowledge, especially empirically developed and evaluated, is quite scarce. In this paper we developed and evaluated a method, AnaConDebt, by analyzing, together with several practitioners, 12 existing cases of Architecture Debt in 6 companies. The method has been refined several times in order to be useful and effective in practice. We also report the evaluation of the method with a final case, for which we present anonymized results and subsequent refactoring decisions. The method consists of several components that need to be analyzed, combining the theoretical Technical Debt framework and the practical experience of the practitioners, in order to identify the key factors involved in the growth of interest. The output of the method shows summarized indicators that visualizes the factors in a useful way for the stakeholders.

This field is concerned with the use of data mining to provide useful insights into how to improve software engineering processes and software itself, supporting decision-making. For that, data produced by software engineering processes and products during and after software development are used. Despite promising results, there is frequently a lack of discussion on the role of software engineering practitioners amidst the data mining approaches. This makes adoption of data mining by software engineering practitioners difficult. Moreover, the fact that experts’ knowledge is frequently ignored by data mining approaches, together with the lack of transparency of such approaches, can hinder the acceptability of data mining by software engineering practitioners. To overcome these problems, this position paper provides a discussion of the role of software engineering experts when adopting data mining approaches. It also argues that this role can be extended to increase experts’ involvement in the process of building data mining models. We believe that such extended involvement is not only likely to increase software engineers’ acceptability of the resulting models, but also improve the models themselves. We also provide some recommendations aimed at increasing the success of experts involvement and model acceptability.</p><br><a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13748-016-0092-2">link</a><br></div><div class="paper-info"><h2>Título 112: Software architects in large-scale distributed projects: An Ericsson case study</h2><h3>Autores: ['Ricardo Britto', 'Darja Smite', 'Lars-Ola Damm']</h3><h4>Ano: 2016</h4><p>Software architects are key assets for successful development projects. However, not much research has investigated the challenges they face in large-scale distributed projects. So, researchers investigated how architects at Ericsson were organized, their roles and responsibilities, and the effort they spent guarding and governing a large-scale legacy product developed by teams at multiple locations. Despite recent trends such as microservices and agile development, Ericsson had to follow a more centralized approach to deal with the challenges of scale, distribution, and monolithic architecture of a legacy software product. So, the architectural decisions were centralized to a team of architects. The team extensively used code reviews to not only check the code's state but also reveal defects that could turn into maintainability problems. The study results also suggest that the effort architects spend designing architecture, guarding its integrity and evolvability, and mentoring development teams is directly related to team maturity. In addition, significant investment is needed whenever new teams and locations are onboarded.</p><br><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7725230?casa_token=IorwcPRrDbsAAAAA:nn0gS2yJ4XdLV2UcuMOvSyls7boEnbDJvzLEFGNNbgqfecULFtzc03sy8P0xYGxyYrgXew0P0N32">link</a><br></div><div class="paper-info"><h2>Título 113: The introduction of technical debt tracking in large companies</h2><h3>Autores: ['Antonio Martini', 'Terese Besker', 'Jan Bosch']</h3><h4>Ano: 2016</h4><p>Large software companies need to support continuous and fast delivery of customer value both in the short and long term.

Although learning is associated with performance improvements, experience shows that training and learning does not always result in a better performance or significant improvements might take too long. Aims: In this paper, we report our experiences from establishing an approach to measure learning results and associated performance impact for developers and teams in Ericsson. Method: Experiences reported herein are a part of an exploratory case study of an on-going large-scale distributed project in Ericsson. The data collected for our measurements included archival data and expert knowledge acquired through both unstructured and semi-structured interviews. While performing the measurements, we faced a number of challenges, documented in the form of lessons learned. Results: We aggregated our experience in eight lessons learned related to collection, preparation and analysis of data for further measurement of learning potential and performance in large-scale distributed software development. Conclusions: Measuring learning and performance is a challenging task. Major problems were related to data inconsistencies caused by, among other factors, distributed nature of the project. We believe that the documented experiences shared herein can help other researchers and practitioners to perform similar measurements and overcome the challenges of large-scale distributed software projects, as well as proactively address these challenges when establishing project measurement programs.</p><br><br><div class="paper-info"><h2>Título 117: Software architecture health monitor</h2><h3>Autores: ['Yuanfang Cai', 'Rick Kazman']</h3><h4>Ano: 2016</h4><p>In this paper, we first discuss the concept of architecture debt and how this debt grows in virtually every software-intensive project. Next we propose a methodology for developers to monitor the health of a project's architecture through an analysis of the development artifacts that a project produces. Our objective is to monitor and manage architecture debt by leveraging an architecture model that we proposed recently, called the Design Rule Space (DRSpace). We use DRSpaces to split a complex system into smaller subsystems based on features, patterns, refactoring targets, etc., so that we can monitor and analyze the evolution and interaction of each subsystem separately. We also employ a recently proposed architectural metric---Decoupling Level---to quantitatively monitor changes in a project's overall level of architecture maintainability.

For the former, software engineers commonly rely on well-known software architecture styles, such as Model-View-Controller (MVC). To the latter, they rely on code metrics and code smell detection approaches. However, up to now, these code metrics and code smell approaches do not take into account underlying architectureall classes are assessed as if they were the same. In practice, software developers know that classes differ in terms of responsibilities and implementation, and thus, we expect these classes to present different levels of coupling, cohesion, and complexity. As an example, in an MVC system, Controllers are responsible for the flow between the Model and the View, and Models are responsible for representing the systems business concepts. Thus, in this thesis, we evaluate the impact of architectural roles within a system architecture on code metrics and code smells. We performed an empirical analysis in 120 open source systems, and interviewed and surveyed more than 50 software developers. Our findings show that each architectural role has a different code metric values distribution, which is a likely consequence of their specific responsibilities. Thus, we propose SATT, an approach that provides specific thresholds for architectural roles that are significantly different from others in terms of code smells. We also show that classes that play a specific architectural role contain specific code smells, which developers perceive as problems, and can impact class' change- and defect-proneness. Based on our findings, we suggest that developers understand the responsibilities of each architectural role in their system architecture, so that code metrics and code smells techniques can provide more accurate feedback.</p><br><a href="https://www.teses.usp.br/teses/disponiveis/45/45134/tde-13092016-123733/en.php">link</a><br></div><div class="paper-info"><h2>Título 119: Preventing Erosion in Exception Handling Design Using Static-Architecture Conformance Checking</h2><h3>Autores: ['Juarez Filho', 'Lincoln Rocha', 'Rossana Andrade', 'Ricardo Britto']</h3><h4>Ano: 2017</h4><p>Exception handling is a common error recovery technique employed to improve software robustness. However, studies have reported that exception handling is commonly neglected by developers and is the least understood and documented part of a software project. The lack of documentation and difficulty in understanding the exception handling design can lead developers to violate important design decisions, triggering an erosion process in the exception handling design. Architectural conformance checking provides means to control the architectural erosion by periodically checking if the actual architecture is consistent with the planned one. Nevertheless, available approaches do not provide a proper support for exception handling conformance checking. To fulfill this gap, we propose ArCatch: an architectural conformance checking solution to deal with the exception handling design erosion. ArCatch provides: (i) a declarative language for expressing design constraints regarding exception handling; and (ii) a design rule checker to automatically verify the exception handling conformance. To evaluate the usefulness and effectiveness of our approach, we conducted a case study, in which we evaluated an evolution scenario composed by 10 versions of an existing web-based Java system. Each version was checked against the same set of exception handling design rules. Based on the results and the feedback given by the system’s architect, the ArCatch proved useful and effective in the identification of existing exception handling erosion problems and locating its causes in the source code.</p><br><a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-65831-5_5">link</a><br></div><div class="paper-info"><h2>Título 120: Revealing social debt with the CAFFEA framework: An antidote to architectural debt</h2><h3>Autores: ['Antonio Martini', 'Jan Bosch']</h3><h4>Ano: 2017</h4><p>Large software companies need a well-managed Software Architecture to support continuous and fast delivery of customer value both in the short and long term.

Even though there is a considerable amount of research related to requirement volatility, the majority of it is inclined toward project management aspects. The relationship between SW architecture design and requirements volatility has not been researched widely, even though changing requirements may for example lead to higher defect density during testing. An exploratory case study was conducted to study how requirements volatility affects SW architecture design. Fifteen semi-structured, thematic interviews were conducted in the case company, which provides the selection of software products for business customers and consumers. The research revealed the factors, such as requirements uncertainty and dynamic business environment, causing requirements volatility in the case company. The study identified the challenges that requirements volatility posed to SW architecture design, including scheduling and architectural technical debt. In addition, this study discusses means of mitigating the factors that cause requirements volatility and addressing the challenges posed by requirements volatility. SW architects are strongly influenced by requirement volatility. Thus understanding the factors causing requirements volatility as well as means to mitigate the challenges has high industrial relevance.</p><br><a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3084100.3084105">link</a><br></div><div class="paper-info"><h2>Título 124: Compiling static software metrics for reliability and maintainability from GitHub repositories</h2><h3>Autores: ['Jeremy Ludwig', 'Steven Xu', 'Frederick Webber']</h3><h4>Ano: 2017</h4><p>this paper identifies a small, essential set of static software code metrics linked to the software product quality characteristics of reliability and maintainability and to the most commonly identified sources of technical debt. A plug-in is created for the Understand code visualization and static analysis tool that calculates and aggregates the metrics. The plug-in produces a high-level interactive html report as well as developer-level information needed to address quality issues using Understand. A script makes use of Git, Understand, and the plug-in to compile results for a list of GitHub repositories into a single file. The primary contribution of this work is to describe an open-source plug-in to measure and visualize architectural complexity based on the propagation cost and core size metrics, which are not currently found in other tools. The plug-in should be useful to researchers and practitioners interested in these two metrics and as an expedient starting point to experimentation with metric collection and aggregation for groups of GitHub repositories.

The core proposition of the paper is that the well-established concept of `risk appetite' can be equally well applied to characterise and classify architects' attitudes towards risk.

To structure and better understand the SE body of knowledge, taxonomies have been proposed in all SE knowledge areas. Objective: The objective of this paper is to characterize the state-of-the-art research on SE taxonomies. Method: A systematic mapping study was conducted, based on 270 primary studies. Results: An increasing number of SE taxonomies have been published since 2000 in a broad range of venues, including the top SE journals and conferences. The majority of taxonomies can be grouped into the following SWEBOK knowledge areas: construction (19.55%), design (19.55%), requirements (15.50%) and maintenance (11.81%). Illustration (45.76%) is the most frequently used approach for taxonomy validation. Hierarchy (53.14%) and faceted analysis (39.48%) are the most frequently used classification structures. Most taxonomies rely on qualitative procedures to classify subject matter instances, but in most cases (86.53%) these procedures are not described in sufficient detail. The majority of the taxonomies (97%) target unique subject matters and many taxonomy-papers are cited frequently. Most SE taxonomies are designed in an ad-hoc way. To address this issue, we have revised an existing method for developing taxonomies in a more systematic way. Conclusion: There is a strong interest in taxonomies in SE, but few taxonomies are extended or revised. Taxonomy design decisions regarding the used classification structures, procedures and descriptive bases are usually not well described and motivated.</p><br><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0950584917300472">link</a><br></div><div class="paper-info"><h2>Título 127: Impact of architectural technical debt on daily software development work—a survey of software practitioners</h2><h3>Autores: ['Terese Besker', 'Antonio Martini', 'Jan Bosch']</h3><h4>Ano: 2017</h4><p>The negative consequences of Technical Debt is an area of increasing interest, and more specifically the Architectural aspects of it have received increased attention in the last few years. Besides the negative effects of Architectural Technical Debt on the overall software product quality in terms of hindering evolution and causing high maintenance costs, Architectural Technical Debt also has a significant negative impact on software practitioners' daily work. Although a great deal of theoretical work on Architectural Technical Debt has been undertaken, there is a lack of empirical studies that examine the negative effects of Architectural Technical Debt during the software development lifecycle. The aim of this study is to investigate how practitioners perceive and estimate the impact of Architectural Technical Debt during the software development process. This paper reports the results of an online web survey providing quantitative data from 258 participants. The contribution of this paper is threefold: First, it shows that practitioners experience that the Architectural type of Technical Debt has the highest negative impact on daily software development work. Secondly, we provide evidence that does not support the commonly held belief that Architectural Technical Debt increases with the age of the software. Thirdly, we show that despite different responsibilities and working tasks of software professionals, Architectural Technical Debt negatively affects all roles without any significant difference between the roles.</p><br><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8051360?casa_token=0Xbqa0F1A6UAAAAA:XzoXkhRWUhrXus45O6STTkM88G7ZPq0ulmTgLk3D8JoPEag82Ywk4n5kKaK7xPMpK58RSUs_BAM3">link</a><br></div><div class="paper-info"><h2>Título 128: An Open Tool for Assisting in Technical Debt Management</h2><h3>Autores: ['Carlos Fernandez-Sanchez', 'Hector Humanes', 'Juan Garbajosa', 'Jessica Diaz']</h3><h4>Ano: 2017</h4><p>Technical debt monitoring is one of the activities that have to be performed in technical debt management.

However, this can be hindered by evolution limitations and high maintenance efforts due to internal software quality issues by what is described as Technical Debt. Although significant theoretical work has been undertaken to describe the negative effects of Technical Debt, these studies tend to have a weak empirical basis and often lack quantitative data. The aim of this study is to estimate wasted time, caused by the Technical Debt interest during the software life-cycle. This study also investigates how practitioners perceive and estimate the impact of the negative consequences due to Technical Debt during the software development process. This paper reports the results of both an online web-survey provided quantitative data from 258 participants and follow-up interviews with 32 industrial software practitioners. The importance and originality of this study contributes and provides novel insights into the research on Technical Debt by quantifying the perceived interest and the negative effects it has on the software development life-cycle. The findings show that on average, 36 percent of all development time is estimated to be wasted due to Technical Debt; Complex Architectural Design and Requirement Technical Debt generates most negative effect; and that most time is wasted on understanding and/or measuring the Technical Debt. Moreover, the analysis of the professional roles and the age of the software system in the survey revealed that different roles are affected differently and that the consequences of Technical Debt are also influenced by the age of the software system.</p><br><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8094405">link</a><br></div><div class="paper-info"><h2>Título 130: Managing the requirements flow from strategy to release in large-scale agile development: a case study at Ericsson</h2><h3>Autores: ['V.T.

Many large organizations are struggling to successfully adopt agile methods, but there is still little scientific knowledge on requirements management in large-scale agile development organizations. We present an in-depth study of an Ericsson telecommunications node development organization which employs a large scale agile method to develop telecommunications system software. We describe how the requirements flow from strategy to release, and related benefits and problems. Data was collected by 43 interviews, which were analyzed qualitatively. The requirements management was done in three different processes, each of which had a different process model, purpose and planning horizon. The release project management process was plan-driven, feature development process was continuous and implementation management process was agile. The perceived benefits included reduced development lead time, increased flexibility, increased planning efficiency, increased developer motivation and improved communication effectiveness. The recognized problems included difficulties in balancing planning effort, overcommitment, insufficient understanding of the development team autonomy, defining the product owner role, balancing team specialization, organizing system-level work and growing technical debt. The study indicates that agile development methods can be successfully employed in organizations where the higher level planning processes are not agile. Combining agile methods with a flexible feature development process can bring many benefits, but large-scale software development seems to require specialist roles and significant coordination effort. © 2016, The Author(s).</p><br><a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10664-016-9491-z">link</a><br></div><div class="paper-info"><h2>Título 131: On the interest of architectural technical debt: Uncovering the contagious debt phenomenon</h2><h3>Autores: ['Antonio Martini', 'Jan Bosch']</h3><h4>Ano: 2017</h4><p>A known problem in large software companies is to balance the prioritization of short-term and long-term business goals. As an example, architecture suboptimality (Architectural Technical Debt), incurred to deliver fast, might hinder future feature development. However, some technical debt generates more interest to be paid than other. We conducted a multi-phase, multiple-case embedded case study comprehending 9 sites at 6 large international software companies. We have investigated which architectural technical debt items generate more interest , how the interest occurs during software development and which costly extra-activities are triggered as a result. We presented a taxonomy of the most dangerous items identified during the qualitative investigation and a model of their effects that can be used for prioritization, for further investigation and as a quality model for extracting more precise and context-specific metrics. We found that some architectural technical debt items are contagious, causing the interest to be not only fixed, but potentially compound, which leads to the hidden growth of interest (possibly exponential). We found important factors to be monitored to refactor the debt before it becomes too costly. Instances of these phenomena need to be identified and stopped before the development reaches a crises.</p><br><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/smr.1877?casa_token=r0qbVcLldkoAAAAA:10cubt0gpOjPQ4uiZ6YcFhiajHXbA1RnzRxez6NE_B-Qrc6tEA2B6UboptXQ0RUvsw14efCRa81YtQ5deg">link</a><br></div><div class="paper-info"><h2>Título 132: Limiting technical debt with maintainability assurance: an industry survey on used techniques and differences with service-and microservice-based systems</h2><h3>Autores: ['Justus Bogner', 'Jonas Fritzsch', 'Stefan Wagner', 'Alfred Zimmermann']</h3><h4>Ano: 2018</h4><p>Maintainability assurance techniques are used to control this quality attribute and limit the accumulation of potentially unknown technical debt.

The results indicate that using explicit and systematic techniques has benefits for maintainability. The more sophisticated the applied methods the more satisfied participants were with the maintainability of their software while no link to a hindrance in productivity could be established. Other important findings were the absence of architecture-level evolvability control mechanisms as well as a significant neglect of service-oriented particularities for quality assurance.

As software evolves with bug fixes, new features, or improvements, unresolved architecture design flaws can contribute to maintenance difficulties. The impact on effort due to architecture design flaws has been difficult to quantify and justify. In this paper, we conducted a case study where we identified flawed architecture relations and quantified their effects on maintenance activities.

However, this can be impeded if the evolution and maintenance of existing systems is hampered by what has been recently termed Technical Debt (TD). Specifically, Architectural TD has re- ceived increased attention in the last few years due to its significant impact on system success and, left unchecked, it can cause expensive repercussions. It is therefore important to understand the underlying factors of architectural TD. With this as background, there is a need for a descriptive model to illustrate and explain different architectural TD issues. The aim of this study is to synthesize and compile research efforts with the goal of creating new knowledge with a specific interest in the architectural TD field. The contribution of this paper is the presentation of a novel descriptive model, providing a comprehensive interpretation of the architectural TD phenomenon. This model categorizes the main characteristics of architectural TD and reveals their relations. The results show that, by using this model, different stake- holders could increase the system’s success rate, and lower the rate of negative consequences, by raising awareness about architectural TD.</p><br><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0164121217302121">link</a><br></div><div class="paper-info"><h2>Título 138: An architectural smells detection tool for c and c++ projects</h2><h3>Autores: ['Andrea Biaggi', 'Francesca Fontana', 'Riccardo Roveda']</h3><h4>Ano: 2018</h4><p>Architectural smells gained great attention in the past few years since they directly affect software quality and increase architectural technical debt.

However, the consequences of potential long-term and far-reaching negative effects of shortcuts and quick fixes made during the software development lifecycle, described as Technical Debt (TD), can impede the software development process.
Objective: The overall goal of this Licentiate thesis is to empirically study and understand in what way and to what extent, TD in general and architectural TD specifically, influence today’s software development work and, specifically, with the intention of providing more quantitative insights into the field.
Method: To achieve the objectives, a combination of both quantitative and qualitative research methodologies are used, including interviews, surveys, a systematic literature review, a longitudinal study, correlation analysis, and statistical tests. In five of the seven included studies, we use a combination of multiple research methods to achieve high validity.
Results: We present results showing that software suffering from TD will cause various different negative effects on both the software and on the developing process. These negative effects can be illustrated from a technical, a financial and from a developer’s working situational perspective.
Conclusion: This thesis contributes to the understanding and quantification of in what way and to what extent TD is harmful to software development organizations. The results show that software practitioners estimate that they waste 36% of their working time due to experiencing TD and that the TD is causing them to perform additional time- consuming work activities.

Planning and estimation are particularly challenging in large and globally distributed agile projects. While software engineering researchers have been investigating effort estimation for many years to help practitioners to improve their estimation processes, there is little empirical research about effort estimation in large-scale distributed projects involving agile teams. Objective: The objective of this paper is three-fold: i) To identify how effort estimation is carried out in large-scale distributed agile projects; ii) to analyze the accuracy of the effort estimation processes in large-scale distributed agile projects; and iii) to identify and investigate the factors that impact the accuracy of effort estimates in large-scale distributed agile projects. Method: We performed an exploratory longitudinal case study. The data collection was operationalized through archival research and semi-structured interviews. Results: The main findings of the studied case are: 1) A two-stage estimation process, with re-estimation at the analysis stage, improves the accuracy of the effort estimates; 2) underestimation is the dominant trend; 3) less mature teams incur larger effort overruns; 4) requirements with larger size/scope incur larger effort overruns; 5) requirements developed in multi-site settings incur larger effort overruns as compared to requirements developed in a co-located setting; 6) requirements priorities impact the accuracy of the effort estimates.

A related phenomenon has been identified in Architectural Technical Debt: if the system architecture is sub-optimal for long-term business goals, it might need to be refactored. A key property of the system assuring long-term goals is its modularity, or else the degree to which components are decoupled: such property allows the product to be evolved without costly changes pervading the whole system. However, understanding the business benefits of refactoring to achieve modularity is not trivial, especially for large refactorings involving substantial architectural changes. Objective The aim of this study was to develop a technique to identify Architectural Technical Debt in the form of a non-modularized component and to quantify the convenience of its repayment. Method We have conducted a single, embedded case study in a large company, comparing a component before and after it was refactored to achieve modularity. We have developed a holistic framework for the semi-automated identification and estimation of Architectural Technical Debt in the form of non-modularized components. We then evaluate the technique reporting a comparative study of the difference in maintenance and development costs in two coexisting systems, one including the refactored component and one including the non-refactored one. Results The main contributions are a measurement system for the identification of the Architectural Technical Debt according to the stakeholders’ goals, a mathematical relationship for calculating and quantifying its interest in terms of extra-effort spent in additional development and maintenance, and an overall decision framework to assess the benefit of refactoring. We also report context-specific results that show the estimated benefits of refactoring the specific case of Architectural Technical Debt. Conclusion We found that it is possible to identify this kind of Architectural Technical Debt and to quantify its repayment convenience. Thanks to the developed framework, it was possible to estimate that the Architectural Technical Debt present in the component was causing substantial continuous extra-effort, and that the modularization would be repaid in several months of development and maintenance.</p><br><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095058491630355X">link</a><br></div><div class="paper-info"><h2>Título 145: Identifying architectural technical debt in android applications through automated compliance checking</h2><h3>Autores: ['Roberto Verdecchia']</h3><h4>Ano: 2018</h4><p>By considering the fast pace at which mobile applications need to evolve, Architectural Technical Debt results to be a crucial yet implicit factor of success.

Currently, it is common to associate any impediment related to the software product and its development process to the definition of TD. This can bring confusion and ambiguity in the use of the term. Besides, due to the increasing amount of work in the area, it is difficult to have a comprehensive view of the plethora of proposals on TD management. Objective This paper intends to investigate the current state of research on TD by identifying what research topics have been considered, organizing research directions and practical knowledge that has already been defined, identifying the known types of TD, and organizing what activities, strategies and tools have been proposed to support the management of TD. Method A tertiary study was performed based on a set of five research questions. In total, 13 secondary studies, dated from 2012 to March 2018, were evaluated. Results The results of this tertiary study are beneficial for both practitioners and researchers. We evolved a taxonomy of TD types, identified a list of situations in which debt items can be found in software projects, and organized a map representing the state of the art of activities, strategies and tools to support TD management. Besides, we also summarized some research directions and practical knowledge, and identified the research topics that have been more considered in secondary studies. Conclusion This tertiary study revisited the TD landscape. Its results can help to identify points that still require further investigation in TD research.</p><br><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0950584918300946">link</a><br></div><div class="paper-info"><h2>Título 147: Design rule spaces: A new model for representing and analyzing software architecture</h2><h3>Autores: ['Yuanfang Cai', 'Lu Xiao', 'Rick Kazman', 'Ran Mo', 'Qiong Feng']</h3><h4>Ano: 2018</h4><p>In this paper, we propose an architecture model called Design Rule Space (DRSpace). We model the architecture of a software system as multiple overlapping DRSpaces, reflecting the fact that any complex software system must contain multiple aspects, features, patterns, etc. We show that this model provides new ways to analyze software quality. In particular, we introduce an Architecture Root detection algorithm that captures DRSpaces containing large numbers of a project's bug-prone files, which are called Architecture Roots (ArchRoots). After investigating ArchRoots calculated from 15 open source projects, the following observations become clear: from 35 to 91 percent of a project's most bug-prone files can be captured by just 5 ArchRoots, meaning that bug-prone files are likely to be architecturally connected. Furthermore, these ArchRoots tend to live in the system for significant periods of time, serving as the major source of bug-proneness and high maintainability costs. Moreover, each ArchRoot reveals multiple architectural flaws that propagate bugs among files and this will incur high maintenance costs over time. The implication of our study is that the quality, in terms of bug-proneness, of a large, complex software project cannot be fundamentally improved without first fixing its architectural flaws.</p><br><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8268667">link</a><br></div><div class="paper-info"><h2>Título 148: How do developers fix issues and pay back technical debt in the Apache ecosystem?</h2><h3>Autores: ['Georgios Digkas', 'Mircea Lungu', 'Paris Avgeriou', 'Alexander Chatzigeorgiou', 'Apostolos Ampatzoglou']</h3><h4>Ano: 2018</h4><p>During software evolution technical debt (TD) follows a constant ebb and flow, being incurred and paid back, sometimes in the same day and sometimes ten years later. There have been several studies in the literature investigating how technical debt in source code accumulates during time and the consequences of this accumulation for software maintenance. However, to the best of our knowledge there are no large scale studies that focus on the types of issues that are fixed and the amount of TD that is paid back during software evolution. In this paper we present the results of a case study, in which we analyzed the evolution of fifty-seven Java open-source software projects by the Apache Software Foundation at the temporal granularity level of weekly snapshots. In particular, we focus on the amount of technical debt that is paid back and the types of issues that are fixed. The findings reveal that a small subset of all issue types is responsible for the largest percentage of TD repayment and thus, targeting particular violations the development team can achieve higher benefits.</p><br><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8330205">link</a><br></div><div class="paper-info"><h2>Título 149: Exploring the relationship between software modularity and technical debt</h2><h3>Autores: ['Peggy Skiada', 'Apostolos Ampatzoglou', 'Elvira-Maria Arvanitou', 'Alexander Chatzigeorgiou', 'Ioannis Stamelos']</h3><h4>Ano: 2018</h4><p>Modularity is one of the key principles of software design. In order for a software system to be modular, it should be organized into modules that are highly coherent internally, whereas at the same time as independent from other modules as possible. In this paper we explore coupling and cohesion metrics at the software package level-i.e., one of most basic levels of software functional decomposition in object-oriented (OO) systems, with the aim of investigating their relation to the technical debt of each package. Current state-of-the-art tools in TD measurement are working on the source code level, and the extent to which they can unveil limitations at the architecture level (e.g., violations of the modularity principle), has not been explored so far. To achieve this goal, we conducted a case study on 1,200 packages retrieved from 20 well-known open source software projects. The results of the study suggested that current measures of technical debt are able to identify / predict modules that lack modularity, and therefore suffer from Architectural Technical Debt (ATD). The results of the study are discussed both from the practitioners' and re-searchers' point of view.</p><br><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8498239">link</a><br></div><div class="paper-info"><h2>Título 150: Exploring multilateral Cloud computing security architectural design debt in terms of technical debt</h2><h3>Autores: ['M Kumar', 'AN Nandakumar']</h3><h4>Ano: 2018</h4><p>This work identifies various design debt causes in a cloud computing system from various dimensions of design debt. Even though immature, un-ripen coded service accessible over the Internet using the cloud computing paradigm may work fine and be wholly tolerable to the patron; but excess quantities will make a service progression that may lead to extreme specialist of software developers and finally an inflexible product. Delivery of the earliest primary beginning coded service without ripeness or maturity is like going into debts or arrears or due to obligation. A petite tiny debt rates progress so protracted as it is paid or rewarded back punctually with a rewrite/redraft/revising/reworking. The risk arises when the debt is not repaid and settled. Every miniature infinitesimal effort spent on imprecise code reckons as interest on that arrears/debt. Intact engineering business can be brought to be idle under the balance load of an unconsolidated, non-solicit implementation, execution, and performance discharging object-oriented, functional or procedural or otherwise.

For instance, certain modules might become coupled due to a new user feature being added or to suboptimal development decisions. Design degradation symptoms are often related to high coupling and unwanted dependencies, such as: cyclic dependencies or violations to design rules, amongst other architectural smells. Thus, the early detection of such symptoms is important for architects to: i) anticipate dependency-related design problems in different parts of the system, ii) assess possible situations of technical debt, and iii) proactively look for solutions to preserve the quality of the system. Although there are approaches that analyse design dependencies in code bases and flag smell occurrences, very few of them have dealt with the prediction of dependency relations amongst software components. This research hypothesises that a predictive approach can warn architects about dependency-related problems before they appear. To this end, a particular graph-based approach is social networks analysis (SNA), which has been used for modelling both nature and human phenomena. Specifically, SNA techniques can predict links that do not yet exist between pairs of nodes in a network. SNA applications have shown evidence that the topological features of dependency graphs can reveal interesting properties of the software system under analysis. Nonetheless, SNA techniques have not yet been extensively exploited in the Software Architecture community. In this context, the question that motivates this research is to what extent SNA can leverage on information from a software design (and its evolution over time) for inferring new dependencies and likely configurations of architectural smells out of those dependencies.</p><br><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8712369">link</a><br></div><div class="paper-info"><h2>Título 152: Investigating instability architectural smells evolution: an exploratory case study</h2><h3>Autores: ['Darius Sas', 'Paris Avgeriou', 'Francesca Fontana']</h3><h4>Ano: 2019</h4><p>Architectural smells may substantially increase maintenance effort and thus require extra attention for potential refactoring. While we currently understand this concept and have identified different types of such smells, we have not yet studied their evolution in depth. This is necessary to inform their prioritisation and refactoring. This study analyses the evolution of individual architectural smell instances over time, and the characteristics that define these instances. Three different types of architectural smells are taken into consideration and mined from a total of 524 versions across 14 different projects. The results show how different smell types differ in multiple aspects, such as their growth rate, the importance of the affected elements over time in the dependency network of the system, and the time each instance affects the system. They also cast valuable insights on what aspects are the most important to consider during prioritisation and refactoring activities.</p><br><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8919109">link</a><br></div><div class="paper-info"><h2>Título 153: Pagerank and criticality of architectural smells</h2><h3>Autores: ['Francesca Fontana', 'Ilaria Pigazzini', 'Claudia Raibulet', 'Stefano Basciano', 'Riccardo Roveda']</h3><h4>Ano: 2019</h4><p>Architectural smells represent symptoms of problems at architectural level that can negatively impact internal software qualities and lead to architectural debt. Detecting architectural smells and identifying the most critical ones is the key to prioritize refactoring efforts and prevent software architecture erosion. In this paper we focus our attention on three architectural smells based on dependency issues, called Cyclic Dependency, Unstable Dependency, and Hub-Like Dependency. Moreover, we evaluate the PageRank and Criticality of these smells through the analysis of six projects. PageRank is a measure that estimates whether an architectural smell is located in an important part of the project, where the importance is evaluated according to how many parts of a project depend on the one involved in the architectural smell. We describe a case study on the analysis of the possible relation existing between the PageRank and Criticality of the smells. The results show how the two measures can be both used to locate the architectural smells that need particular inspections and attention.</p><br><a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3344948.3344982">link</a><br></div><div class="paper-info"><h2>Título 154: Evolution of the Unix system architecture: an exploratory case study</h2><h3>Autores: ['Diomidis Spinellis', 'Paris Avgeriou']</h3><h4>Ano: 2019</h4><p>Unix has evolved for almost five decades, shaping modern operating systems, key software technologies, and development practices. Studying the evolution of this remarkable system from an architectural perspective can provide insights on how to manage the growth of large, complex, and long-lived software systems. Along main Unix releases leading to the FreeBSD lineage we examine core architectural design decisions, the number of features, and code complexity, based on the analysis of source code, reference documentation, and related publications. We report that the growth in size has been uniform, with some notable outliers, while cyclomatic complexity has been religiously safeguarded. A large number of Unix-defining design decisions were implemented right from the very early beginning, with most of them still playing a major role. Unix continues to evolve from an architectural perspective, but the rate of architectural innovation has slowed down over the system's lifetime. Architectural technical debt has accrued in the forms of functionality duplication and unused facilities, but in terms of cyclomatic complexity it is systematically being paid back through what appears to be a self-correcting process. Some unsung architectural forces that shaped Unix are the emphasis on conventions over rigid enforcement, the drive for portability, a sophisticated ecosystem of other operating systems and development organizations, and the emergence of a federated architecture, often through the adoption of third-party subsystems. These findings have led us to form an initial theory on the architecture evolution of large, complex operating system software.</p><br><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8704965">link</a><br></div><div class="paper-info"><h2>Título 155: Is self-admitted technical debt a good indicator of architectural divergences?</h2><h3>Autores: ['Giancarlo Sierra', 'Ahmad Tahmid', 'Emad Shihab', 'Nikolaos Tsantalis']</h3><h4>Ano: 2019</h4><p>Large software systems tend to be highly complex and often contain unaddressed issues that evolve from bad design practices or architectural implementations that drift from definition. These design flaws can originate from quick fixes, hacks or shortcuts to a solution, hence they can be seen as Technical Debt. Recently, new work has focused on studying source code comments that indicate Technical Debt, i.e., Self-Admitted Technical Debt (SATD). However, it is not known if addressing information left by developers in the form source code comments can give insight about the design flaws in a system and have the potential to provide fixes for bad architectural implementations. This paper investigates the possibility of using SATD comments to resolve architectural divergences. We leverage a data set of previously classified SATD comments to trace them to the architectural divergences of a large open source system, namely ArgoUML. We extract its conceptual and concrete architectures based on available design documentation and source code, and contrast both to expose divergences, trace them to SATD comments, and investigate their resolution. We found 7 high-level divergences in ArgoUML and 22 others among its subsystems, observing that merely 4 out of 29 (14%) divergences can be directly traced to SATD. Although using SATD as an indicator of architectural divergences is viable, the effort of doing so is time-intensive, and in general, will not lend to a significant reduction of architectural flaws in a software system.</p><br><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8667999">link</a><br></div><div class="paper-info"><h2>Título 156: DV8: automated architecture analysis tool suites</h2><h3>Autores: ['Yuanfang Cai', 'Rick Kazman']</h3><h4>Ano: 2019</h4><p>This paper present our tool suite called DV8.

Since insights into the current state of practice are very important for researchers, we performed a qualitative interview study to explore applied evolvability assurance processes, the usage of tools, metrics, and patterns, as well as participants' reflections on the topic. In 17 semi-structured interviews, we discussed 14 different Microservice-based systems with software professionals from 10 companies and how the sustainable evolution of these systems was ensured. Interview transcripts were analyzed with a detailed coding system and the constant comparison method. We found that especially systems for external customers relied on central governance for the assurance. Participants saw guidelines like architectural principles as important to ensure a base consistency for evolvability. Interviewees also valued manual activities like code review, even though automation and tool support was described as very important. Source code quality was the primary target for the usage of tools and metrics. Despite most reported issues being related to Architectural Technical Debt (ATD), our participants did not apply any architectural or service-oriented tools and metrics. While participants generally saw their Microservices as evolvable, service cutting and finding an appropriate service granularity with low coupling and high cohesion were reported as challenging. Future Microservices research in the areas of evolution and technical debt should take these findings and industry sentiments into account.</p><br><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8919247">link</a><br></div><div class="paper-info"><h2>Título 158: Managing Technical Debt: Reducing Friction in Software Development</h2><h3>Autores: ['Philippe Kruchten', 'Robert Nord', 'Ipek Ozkaya']</h3><h4>Ano: 2019</h4><br><a href="https://books.google.com.br/books?hl=pt-PT&lr=&id=R3qSDwAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PT15&dq=Managing+Technical+Debt:+Reducing+Friction+in+Software+Development&ots=fpkMXWfSmP&sig=s8cE0Xy8qVPBzwnSO4r1K1lFt0g#v=onepage&q=Managing%20Technical%20Debt%3A%20Reducing%20Friction%20in%20Software%20Development&f=false">link</a><br></div><div class="paper-info"><h2>Título 159: Active hotspot: an issue-oriented model to monitor software evolution and degradation</h2><h3>Autores: ['Qiong Feng', 'Yuanfang Cai', 'Rick Kazman', 'Di Cui', 'Ting Liu', 'Hongzhou Fang']</h3><h4>Ano: 2019</h4><p>Architecture degradation has a strong negative impact on software quality and can result in significant losses. Severe software degradation does not happen overnight. Software evolves continuously, through numerous issues, fixing bugs and adding new features, and architecture flaws emerge quietly and largely unnoticed until they grow in scope and significance when the system becomes difficult to maintain. Developers are largely unaware of these flaws or the accumulating debt as they are focused on their immediate tasks of address individual issues. As a consequence, the cumulative impacts of their activities, as they affect the architecture, go unnoticed. To detect these problems early and prevent them from accumulating into severe ones we propose to monitor software evolution by tracking the interactions among files revised to address issues. In particular, we propose and show how we can automatically detect active hotspots, to reveal architecture problems. We have studied hundreds of hotspots along the evolution timelines of 21 open source projects and showed that there exist just a few dominating active hotspots per project at any given time. Moreover, these dominating active hotspots persist over long time periods, and thus deserve special attention. Compared with state-of-the-art design and code smell detection tools we report that, using active hotspots, it is possible to detect signs of software degradation both earlier and more precisely.</p><br><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8952512">link</a><br></div><div class="paper-info"><h2>Título 160: A longitudinal study of identifying and paying down architecture debt</h2><h3>Autores: ['Maleknaz Nayebi', 'Yuanfang Cai', 'Rick Kazman', 'Guenther Ruhe', 'Qiong Feng', 'Chris Carlson', 'Francis Chew']</h3><h4>Ano: 2019</h4><p>Architecture debt is a form of technical debt that derives from the gap between the intended and the actual architecture design. In this study we measured architecture debt in two ways: 1) in terms of system-wide coupling measures, and 2) in terms of the number and severity of architecture flaws. In recent research it was shown that the amount of architecture debt has a huge impact on software maintainability and evolution. Consequently, reducing debt is expected to make software less costly and more amenable to change. This paper reports on a longitudinal study of a healthcare communications product created by BrightSquid Secure Communications Corp. This young company is facing the typical trade-off problem of desiring responsiveness to change requests, but wanting to avoid the ever-increasing effort that the accumulation of quick-and-dirty changes eventually incurs. In the first stage of the study, we analyzed the status of the "before" system, which showed the impacts of change requests. This initial study motivated a more in-depth analysis of architecture debt. The results of this debt analysis were used in the second stage of the work to motivate a comprehensive refactoring of the software system. The third stage was a follow-on architecture debt analysis which quantified the improvements realized. Using this quantitative evidence, augmented by qualitative evidence gathered from in-depth interviews with BrightSquid's architects, we present lessons learned about the costs and benefits of paying down architecture debt in practice.</p><br><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8804435">link</a><br></div><div class="paper-info"><h2>Título 161: Software architecture social debt: managing the incommunicability factor</h2><h3>Autores: ['Damian Tamburri']</h3><h4>Ano: 2019</h4><p>Architectural technical debt is the additional project cost connected to technical issues nested in software architectures.

However, since today's software companies face increasing pressure to deliver customer value continuously, the balance between spending developer time, effort, and resources on implementing new features or spending it on refactoring of technical debt becomes vital. The goal of this study is to explore how the prioritization of technical debt is carried out by practitioners within today's software industry. This study also investigates what factors influence the prioritization process and its related challenges. This paper reports the results of surveying 17 software practitioners, together with follow-up interviews with them. Our results show that there is no uniform way of prioritizing technical debt and that it is commonly done reactively without applying any explicit strategies. Often, technical debt issues are managed and prioritized in a shadow backlog, separate from the official sprint backlog. This study was also able to identify several different challenges related to prioritizing technical debt, such as the lack of quantitative information about the technical debt items and that the refactoring of technical debt issues competes with the implementation of customer requirements.</p><br><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8786030">link</a><br></div><div class="paper-info"><h2>Título 163: VisminerTD: a tool for automatic identification and interactive monitoring of the evolution of technical debt items</h2><h3>Autores: ['Thiago Mendes', 'Felipe Gomes', 'David Gon{\\c{c}}alves', 'Manoel Mendon{\\c{c}}a', 'Renato Novais', "Rodrigo Sp{\\'\\i}nola"]</h3><h4>Ano: 2019</h4><p>Technical debt (TD) contextualizes problems faced during software evolution considering the tasks that are not carried out adequately during software development. Software TD is a type of debt that brings a short-term benefit, but which may have to be paid with interest later on in the software development life cycle. Its presence brings risks to the project and can reduce its quality. It is worthwhile to have automatic mechanisms to monitor it, as TD monitoring requires the analysis of large amounts of complex data. Therefore, the combination of software metrics and code comment analysis, in the identification, and information visualization techniques, in monitoring, present themselves as a promising strategy to manage TD. This work presents VisminerTD, a tool that allows the automatic identification and interactive monitoring of the evolution of TD items by combining software metrics, code comment analysis, and information visualization. To evaluate its applicability, a feasibility study was carried out considering JUnit 4 and Apache Ant software projects. The results indicated that VisminerTD can support software development teams in monitoring TD items. In addition, a second case study was performed to assess the feasibility of the proposed tool regarding its usefulness, ease of use, and self-predicted future use. The results provided positive evidence on the use of the proposed tool, indicating (i) that it can be useful in supporting TD Identification and TD monitoring activities and (ii) that it can bring gains in terms of comprehensiveness and efficacy when evaluating the desirable time to identify and monitor different types of debt. Given the current scenario characterized by limited options of tools that combine different information to support automatic identification and monitoring of the evolution of TD items in software projects, VisminerTD can approximate the state-of-the-art and the state-of-the-practice in the TD area, contributing to a wider dissemination of the concept.</p><br><a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13173-018-0083-1">link</a><br></div><div class="paper-info"><h2>Título 164: A proposed model-driven approach to manage architectural technical debt life cycle</h2><h3>Autores: ["Boris P{\\'e}rez", "Dar{\\'\\i}o Correal", "Hern{\\'a}n Astudillo"]</h3><h4>Ano: 2019</h4><p>Architectural Technical Debt (ATD) is a metaphor used to describe consciously decisions taken by software architects to accomplish short-term goals but possibly negatively affecting the long-term health of the system.

In this paper, we emphasize the change in scalability requirements due to new regulations. Scalability is the ability of a system to handle an increased workload. For complex systems that are abruptly exposed via open interfaces and hence a greater workload, the scalability requirements may quickly increase, leading to technical debt. We term this scalability debt. This paper describes scalability triage, a light-weight, novel technique for identifying scalability threats as a form of technical debt. We illustrate this technique with an open banking case from a large software organization. Open banking is partly caused by the new European PSD2 regulative that enforce banks to open interfaces to unknown third-party actors. Banking systems are well-established, mature systems. However, with the advent of open banking and PSD2, the workload may quickly rocket. This leads to tougher scalability requirements and accumulated architectural debt, despite previously sound architectural decisions. Using scalability triage, such risks may be identified fast.

Objective: To empirically investigate the causal relationship between architectural technical debt and the affects of software practitioners. Method: A mixed-methods approach with 40 software practitioners from 12 companies was used, combining repeated measurements laboratory experiments and semi-structured interviews. Result: Based on a set of 200 data points, the existence of tiny tangles negatively impacts the valence of software practitioners with more than 99 % certainty. No links were found between professional background and variations in affective state. Moreover, software practitioners receive positive affects from challenging software engineering tasks and negative affects from architectural technical debt and deadlines. Limitation: The subjects were industry professionals obtained through convenience sampling. Additionally, the treatments, albeit similar to industry code, were small and isolated examples that lacked the full spread and severity of technical debt encountered in practice. Conclusion: By combining our results with the existing literature on psychoempirical software engineering, strong arguments can be made in favour of the hypothesis that the effects of technical debt on industry professionals carry high technological and financial risks.</p><br><a href="https://odr.chalmers.se/handle/20.500.12380/300046">link</a><br></div><div class="paper-info"><h2>Título 170: Architectural technical debt in microservices: a case study in a large company</h2><h3>Autores: ['Saulo Toledo', 'Antonio Martini', 'Agata Przybyszewska', 'Dag Sj{\\o}berg']</h3><h4>Ano: 2019</h4><p>Introduction: Software companies aim to achieve continuous delivery to constantly provide value to their customers. A popular strategy is to use microservices architecture. However, such an architecture is also subject to debt, which hinders the continuous delivery process and thus negatively affects the software released to the customers. Objectives: The aim of this study is to identify issues, solutions and risks related to Architecture Technical Debt in microservices. Method: We conducted an exploratory case study of a real life project with about 1000 services in a large, international company. Through qualitative analysis of documents and interviews, we investigated Architecture Technical Debt in the communication layer of a system with microservices architecture. Results: Our main contributions are a list of Architecture Technical Debt issues specific for the communication layer in a system with microservices architecture, as well as their associated negative impact (interest), a solution to repay the debt and the its cost (principal). Among the found Architecture Technical Debt issues were the existence of business logic in the communication layer and a high amount of point-to-point connections between services. The studied solution consists of the implementation of different canonical models specific to different domains, the removal of business logic from the communication layer, and migration from services to use the communication layer correctly. We also contributed with a list of possible risks that can affect the payment of the debt, as lack of funding and inadequate prioritization. Conclusion: We found issues, solutions and possible risks that are specific for microservices architectures not yet encountered in the current literature. Our results may be useful for practitioners that want to avoid or repay Technical Debt in their microservices architecture.</p><br><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8786035?casa_token=FfUd65YDakoAAAAA:p6KSgSC_uLds9a6ce5BPfiu1n99fBAuSBXWQGC88b9PbSRCOtKLtY87S6DMjhpgc0IJJGwJQHvFz">link</a><br></div><div class="paper-info"><h2>Título 171: A preliminary analysis of self-adaptive systems according to different issues</h2><h3>Autores: ['Claudia Raibulet', 'Francesca Fontana', 'Simone Carettoni']</h3><h4>Ano: 2020</h4><p>Self-adaptive systems dynamically change their structure and behavior in response to changes in their execution environment to ensure the quality of the services they provide. Self-adaptive systems are usually built of a managed part, which implements their functionality, and a managing part, which implements the self-adaptive mechanisms. Hence, the complexity of self-adaptive systems results also from the existence of the managing part and the interaction between the managed and the managing parts. The available evaluation approaches of self-adaptive systems focus on their performances, i.e., on the benefits (e.g., degree of autonomy, support for detecting anomalous behavior, adaptivity time, quality of response) achieved through the self-adaptive mechanisms of the managing part. In this paper, we evaluate the quality of the design of self-adaptive systems (including the managed and the managing parts) as it is done in traditional software engineering. We are interested in the internal software quality of self-adaptive systems, as the existence of the managing part and its interaction with the managed part leads to a tightly coupled system. We analyze the self-adaptive systems through the detection of different issues such as architectural and code smells and the detection of design patterns. The smells provide some hints on possible design and implementation problems, and help software engineers to improve the quality of the systems. While, design patterns are usually indicators of the application of good practices in the software development and allow to capture part of the design rationale. In this way, they can help software engineers to understand, reuse, and extend self-adaptive systems. In this paper, we have considered the detection of 3 architectural smells, 18 code smells, and 15 design patterns in 11 self-adaptive systems written in the Java programming language. The results indicate that the 3 architectural smells, 9 out of the 18 code smells, and the 15 design patterns have been detected in all the analyzed self-adaptive systems. We also discuss the possible reasons behind the presence of these quality issues, and provide our lessons learned.</p><br><a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11219-020-09502-5">link</a><br></div><div class="paper-info"><h2>Título 172: A modeling method for systematic architecture reconstruction of microservice-based software systems</h2><h3>Autores: ['Florian Rademacher', 'Sabine Sachweh', 'Albert Z{\\"u}ndorf']</h3><h4>Ano: 2020</h4><p>Microservice Architecture (MSA) is an approach to architecting service-based software systems, which aims for decreasing service coupling to enable independent service development and deployment. Consequently, the adoption of MSA is expected to particularly benefit the scalability, maintainability, and reliability of monolithic systems. However, MSA adoption also increases architectural complexity in service design, implementation, and operation. As a result, Software Architecture Reconstruction (SAR) of microservice architectures is aggravated. This paper presents a modeling method that systematizes SAR of microservice architectures with the goal to facilitate its execution. The method yields reconstruction models for certain architecture viewpoints in MSA to enable efficient architecture analysis. We validate the method’s applicability by means of a case study architecture and the assessment of its risk in technical debt using derived reconstruction models.</p><br><a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-49418-6_21">link</a><br></div><div class="paper-info"><h2>Título 173: Improving agility by managing shared libraries in microservices</h2><h3>Autores: ['Saulo Toledo', 'Antonio Martini', 'Dag Sj{\\o}berg']</h3><h4>Ano: 2020</h4><p>Using microservices is a way of supporting an agile architecture. However, if the microservices development is not properly managed, the teams’ development velocity may be affected, reducing agility and increasing architectural technical debt. This paper investigates how to manage the use of shared libraries in microservices to improve agility during development. We interviewed practitioners from four large international companies involved in microservices projects to identify problems when using shared libraries. Our results show that the participating companies had issues with shared libraries as follows: coupling among teams, delays on fixes due to overhead on libraries development teams, and need to maintain many versions of the libraries. Our results highlight that the use of shared libraries may hinder agility on microservices. Thus, their use should be restricted to situations where shared libraries cannot be replaced by a microservice and the costs of replicating the code on each service is very high.</p><br><a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-58858-8_20">link</a><br></div><div class="paper-info"><h2>Título 174: Characterizing Architectural Drifts of Adaptive Systems</h2><h3>Autores: ["Daniel San Mart{\\'\\i}n", 'Bento Siqueira', 'Valter Camargo', 'Fabiano Ferrari']</h3><h4>Ano: 2020</h4><p>An adaptive system (AS) evaluates its own behavior and changes it when the evaluation indicates that the system is not accomplishing what it is intended to do, or when better functionality or performance is possible. MAPE-K is a reference model that prescribes the adaptation mechanism of ASs by means of high-level abstractions such as Monitors, Analyzers, Planners and Executors and the relationships among them. Since the abstractions and the relationships provided by MAPE-K are generic, other reference models were proposed focusing on providing lower level abstractions to support software engineers in a more suitable way. However, after the analysis of seven representative ASs, we realized the abstractions prescribed by the existing reference models are not properly implemented, thus leading to architectural drifts. Therefore, in this paper we characterized three of these drifts by describing them with a template and showing practical examples. The three architectural drifts of ASs are Scattered Reference Inputs, Mixed Executors and Effectors, and Obscure Alternatives. We expect that by identifying and characterizing these drifts, we can help software architects improve their design and, as a consequence, increase the reliability of this type of systems.</p><br><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9054856?casa_token=Od4vUkJ1kocAAAAA:0IGig1qo45rRereF3jTKVyy_luZsZntm3NGmSEpT_3BqrPvCS7HWLoBHJiJ0czeKtb3zGwHrqaif">link</a><br></div><div class="paper-info"><h2>Título 175: Software Architecture Reconstruction via a Genetic Algorithm: Applying the Move Class Refactoring</h2><h3>Autores: ['Theodoros Maikantis', 'Angeliki-Agathi Tsintzira', 'Apostolos Ampatzoglou', 'Elvira-Maria Arvanitou', 'Alexander Chatzigeorgiou', 'Ioannis Stamelos', 'Stamatia Bibi', 'Ignatios Deligiannis']</h3><h4>Ano: 2020</h4><p>Modularity is one of the four key principles of software design and architecture. According to this principle, software should be organized into modules that are tightly linked internally (high cohesion), whereas at the same time as independent from other modules as possible (low coupling). However, in practice, this principle is violated due to poor architecting design decisions, lack of time, or coding shortcuts, leading to a phenomenon termed as architectural technical debt (ATD). To alleviate this problem (lack of architectural modularity), the most common solution is the application of a software refactoring, namely Move Class—i.e., moving classes (the core artifact in object-oriented systems) from one module to another. To identify Move Class refactoring opportunities, we employ a search-based optimization process, relying on optimization metrics, through which optimal moves are derived. Given the extensive search space required for applying a brute-force search strategy, in this paper, we propose the use of a genetic algorithm that re-arranges existing software classes into existing or new modules (software packages in Java, or folders in C++). To validate the usefulness of the proposed refactorings, we performed an industrial case study on three projects (from the Aviation, Healthcare, and Manufacturing application domains). The results of the study indicate that the proposed architecture reconstruction is able to improve modularity, improving both coupling and cohesion. The obtained results can be useful to practitioners through an open source tool; whereas at the same point, they open interesting future work directions.</p><br><a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3437120.3437292">link</a><br></div><div class="paper-info"><h2>Título 176: Managing security debt across PLC phases in a VSE context</h2><h3>Autores: ['Xabier Larrucea', 'Izaskun Santamaria', 'Borja Fernandez-Gauna']</h3><h4>Ano: 2020</h4><p>Nowadays, security and safety aspects are two of the major concerns for any software system development, especially while developing safety critical systems. This is especially relevant for very small entities because they have a limited amount of resources for dealing with all these aspects at the same time. In addition, these systems are highly regulated domains, and they involve a huge set of standards focused on safety and security-related issues. Therefore, these small entities are not only facing hurdles related to technical aspects but also from the so-called technical debt when overarching a critical development.

To ensure that software remains useful, new features have to be added or old features have to be adapted to respond to new or changed requirements. As time goes on, some of the features become obsolete, i.e., are not needed anymore. Typically, these features are not removed because of various reasons, e.g., because removing them might be considered too costly, the costs of keeping unused features is considered low, or because of the "sunk cost fallacy", i.e., that a feature is considered worth to keep because of the previously invested resources (time, money or effort) to build it. The consequences of keeping unused source code can impact maintainability, technical debt, performance, and extensibility of the system. This can lead to lower development productivity and to a reduced innovation ability, consequently reducing competitiveness on the market.

More software is being created and has to be maintained. Agile methodologies, in particular Scrum, are widely used by development teams around the world. Estimation is an often practised step in sprint planning. The subject matter of this paper is the impact technical debt has on estimations. Objective: The goal of this research is to identify estimation problems and their solutions due to previously introduced technical debt in software projects. Method: The Systematic mapping study (SMS) method was applied in the research. Papers were selected from the popular digital databases (IEEE, ACM, Scopus, etc.) using defined search criteria. Afterwards, a snowballing procedure was performed and the final publication set was filtered using inclusion/exclusion criteria. Results: 42 studies were selected and evaluated. Five categories of problems and seven proposed solutions to the problems have been extracted from the papers. Problems include items related to business perspective (delivery pressure or lack of technical debt understanding by business decision-makers) and technical perspective (difficulties in forecasting architectural technical debt impact or limits of source code analysis). Solutions were categorized in: more sophisticated decision-making tools for business managers, better tools for estimation support and technical debt management tools on an architectural-level, portfolio approach to technical debt, code audit and technical debt reduction routine conducted every sprint. Conclusion: The results of this mapping study can help taking the appropriate approach in technical debt mitigation in organizations. However, the outcome of the conducted research shows that the problem of measuring technical debt impact on estimations has not yet been solved. We propose several directions for further investigation.

Architectural decisions are considered one of the most common sources of technical debt, therefore, it becomes relevant to understand what causes lead to technical debt from the point of view of software architects. To accomplish this task, we used a survey research method to collect and analyze a corpus of 28 software architects from Colombia, as a part of the InsighTD project. Results showed that inappropriate planning is the most cited technical debt cause by software architects. However, results differ when comparison against engineers and manager are performed. Innacurate time estimate and producing more without quality were the most selected causes of technical debt according to engineers and managers. To improve this comparison, the rank-biased overlapping technique was used.

Existing software tools enable characterizing and measuring the amount of technical debt at selective granularity levels; by providing a computational model, they enable stakeholders to measure and ultimately control this phenomenon. Aims: In this paper we aim to study the evolution and characteristics of technical debt in open-source software. For this, we carry out a longitudinal study that covers the entire development history of several complex applications. The goal is to improve our understanding of how the amount and composition of technical debt changes in evolving software. We also study how new technical debt is introduced in software, as well as identify how developers handle its accumulation over the long term. Method: We carried out our evaluation using three complex, open-source Java applications. All 110 released versions, covering more than 10 years of development history for each application were analyzed using SonarQube. We studied how the amount, composition and history of technical debt changed during development, compared our results across the studied applications and present our most important findings. Results: For each application, we identified key versions during which large amounts of technical debt were added, removed or both. This had significantly more impact when compared to the lines of code or class count increases that generally occurred during development. However, within each version, we found high correlation between file lines of code and technical debt. We observed that the Pareto principle was satisfied for the studied applications, as 20% of issue types generated around 80% of total technical debt. Interestingly, there was a large degree of overlap between the issues that generated most of the debt across the studied applications. Conclusions: Early application versions showed greater fluctuation in the amount of existing technical debt. We found application size to be an unreliable predictor for the quantity of technical debt. Most debt was introduced in applications as part of milestone releases that expanded their feature set; likewise, we identified releases where extensive refactoring significantly reduced the level of debt. We also discovered that technical debt issues persist for a long time in source code, and their removal did not appear to be prioritized according to type or severity.</p><br><a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3382494.3410673">link</a><br></div><div class="paper-info"><h2>Título 182: Methods for Identifying Architectural Debt: A Systematic Mapping Study</h2><h3>Autores: ['Yagup Macit', 'G{\\"o}rkem Giray', 'Eray T{\\"u}z{\\"u}n']</h3><h4>Ano: 2020</h4><p>Technical debt in general refers to suboptimal decisions the practitioners make during software development that achieve short-term goals at the expense of long-term quality concerns.

Project Managers tend to delay paying off this debt because they face difficulties in comparing the cost of the refactoring against the benefits they gain. For these managers to decide whether to refactor or to postpone, they need to estimate the cost and the efforts required to conduct these refactoring ac- tivities as well as to decide which flaws have higher priority to be refactored among others.
Our research is based on a dataset used by other researchers in the technical debt field. It includes more than 18,000 refactoring operations performed on 33 apache java projects. To estimate the refactoring efforts done, we applied the COCOMO II:2000 model to calculate the refactoring cost in person-months units per release. Furthermore, we investigated the correla- tion between the refactoring efforts and two static code metrics of the refac- tored code, mainly, the LOC and the complexity. The research revealed a moderate correlation between the refactoring efforts and each one of the size of the project and code complexity. Finally, we applied the DesigniteJava tool and machine learning practices to verify our research results. From the analysis we found a significant correlation between the ranking of the architecture smells and the ranking of refactoring efforts for each package. Using machine learning practices, we took the architecture smells level and the code metrics of each release as an input to predict the levels of the refac- toring effort of the next release.

However, developing applications based on microservices also brings some drawbacks, such as the increased software operational complexity. Recent studies have also pointed out the lack of methods to prevent problems related to the maintainability of these solutions. Disregarding established design principles during the software evolution may lead to the so-called architectural erosion, which can end up in a condition of unfeasible maintenance. As microservices can be considered a new architecture style, there are few initiatives to monitoring the evolution of software microservice-based architectures. In this paper, we introduce the SYMBIOTE method for monitoring the coupling evolution of microservice-based systems. More specifically, this method collects coupling metrics during runtime (staging or production environments) and monitors them throughout software evolution. The longitudinal analysis of the collected measures allows detecting an upward trend in coupling metrics that could represent signs of architectural degradation. To develop the proposed method, we performed an experimental analysis of the coupling metrics behavior using artificially generated data. The results of these experiment revealed the metrics behavior in different scenarios, providing insights to develop the analysis method for the identification of architectural degradation. We evaluated the SYMBIOTE method in a real-case open source project called Spinnaker. The results obtained in this evaluation show the relationship between architectural changes and upward trends in coupling metrics for most of the analyzed release intervals. Therefore, the first version of SYMBIOTE has shown potential to detect signs of architectural degradation during the evolution of microservice-based architectures.</p><br><a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13173-021-00120-y">link</a><br></div><div class="paper-info"><h2>Título 190: Importance of software architectures in mobile projects</h2><h3>Autores: ['Drago{\\c{s}} Dobrean', 'Laura Dio{\\c{s}}an']</h3><h4>Ano: 2021</h4><p>Mobile projects often exhibit architectural issues. In this paper, we survey three different types of persons (instructors, students, and developers) to find out how often do those who write code struggle with architectural issues and how are those issues impacting their work. Our focus was on mobile projects, but to have a comprehensive overview, we have also questioned students - who might become mobile developers, to see if they understand the importance of architecture in their projects. We were also interested in instructors and their experience with the students on whether or not they lack architectural knowledge. Our research has found that all the questioned developers struggle with architectural issues in their projects, over 60% of the students had to re-write a project due to architectural issues, and over 94% of the questioned instructors stated that students have architectural issues in the projects they develop. The vast majority of the participants to the survey (100% of instructors, 100% of students, and 90% of developers) agreed that a tool that could validate the software architecture would help them.

To conduct this review, we examined an initial dataset of 7,811 articles and found 75 relevant and high-quality secondary analyses of software quality research. Synthesizing this body of work, we offer an overview of perspectives, measurement approaches, and trends. We identify five distinct perspectives that conceptualize quality as heuristic, as maintainability, as a holistic concept, as structural features of software, and as dependability. We also identify three key challenges. First, we find widespread evidence of validity questions with common measures. Second, we observe the application of machine learning methods without adequate evaluation. Third, we observe the use of aging datasets. Finally, from these observations, we sketch a path toward a theoretical framework that will allow software engineering researchers to systematically confront these weaknesses while remaining grounded in the experiences of developers and the real world in which code is ultimately deployed.</p><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.13687">link</a><br></div><div class="paper-info"><h2>Título 192: Legacy Digital Transformation: TCO and ROI Analysis</h2><h3>Autores: ['Ravi Kiran Mallidi', 'Manmohan Sharma', 'Jagjit Singh']</h3><h4>Ano: 2021</h4><p>Legacy Digital Transformation is modernizing or migrating systems from non-digital or older digital technology to newer digital technologies. Digitalization is essential for information reading, processing, transforming, and storing. Social media, Cloud, and analytics are the major technologies in today's digital world. Digitalization (business process) and Digital Transformation (the effect) are the core elements of newer global policies and processes. Recent COVID pandemic situation, Organizations are willing to digitalize their environment without losing business. Digital technologies help to improve their capabilities to transform processes that intern promote new business models. Applications cannot remain static and should modernize to meet the evolving business and technology needs. Business needs time to market, Agility, and reduce technical debt. Technology needs consist of APIs, better Security, Portability, Scalability, Cloud support, Deployment, Automation, and Integration. This paper elaborates different transformation/modernization approaches for Legacy systems written in very long or End of Life (EOL) systems to newer digital technologies to serve the business needs. EOL impacts application production, supportability, compliance, and security. Organizations spend money and resources on Digital Transformation for considering Investment versus Return on Investment, Agility of the System, and improved business processes. Migration and Modernization are critical for any Legacy Digital Transformation. Management takes decisions to proceed with Digital Transformation for considering Total Cost Ownership (TCO) and Return on Investment (ROI) of the program. The paper also includes a TCO-ROI calculator for Transformation from Legacy / Monolithic to new architectures like Microservices.</p><br><a href="https://hrcak.srce.hr/clanak/380657">link</a><br></div><div class="paper-info"><h2>Título 193: Exploring the relation between co-changes and architectural smells</h2><h3>Autores: ['Darius Sas', 'Paris Avgeriou', 'Ronald Kruizinga', 'Ruben Scheedler']</h3><h4>Ano: 2021</h4><p>The interplay between Maintainability and Reliability can be particularly complex and different kinds of trade-offs may arise when developers try to optimise for either one of these two qualities. To further understand how Maintainability and Reliability influence each other, we perform an empirical study using architectural smells and source code file co-changes as proxies for these two qualities, respectively. The study is designed using an exploratory multiple-case case study following well-know guidelines and using fourteen open source Java projects. Three different research questions are identified and investigated through statistical analysis. Co-changes are detected by using both a state-of-the-art algorithm and a novel approach. The three architectural smells selected are among the most important from the literature and are detected using open source tools. The results show that 50% of co-changes eventually end up taking part in an architectural smell. Moreover, statistical tests indicate that in 50% of the projects, files and packages taking part in smells are more likely to co-change than non-smelly files. Finally, co-changes were also found to appear before smells 90% of the times a smell and a co-change appear in the same file pair. Our findings show that Reliability is indirectly affected by low levels of Maintainability even at the architectural level. This is because low-quality components require more frequent changes by the developers, increasing chances to eventually introduce faults.</p><br><a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42979-020-00407-5">link</a><br></div><div class="paper-info"><h2>Título 194: Understanding architecture erosion: The practitioners’ perceptive</h2><h3>Autores: ['Ruiyin Li', 'Peng Liang', 'Mohamed Soliman', 'Paris Avgeriou']</h3><h4>Ano: 2021</h4><p>As software systems evolve, their architecture is meant to adapt accordingly by following the changes in requirements, the environment, and the implementation. However, in practice, the evolving system often deviates from the architecture, causing severe consequences to system maintenance and evolution. This phenomenon of architecture erosion has been studied extensively in research, but not yet been examined from the point of view of developers. In this exploratory study, we look into how developers perceive the notion of architecture erosion, its causes and consequences, as well as tools and practices to identify and control architecture erosion. To this end, we searched through several popular online developer communities for collecting data of discussions related to architecture erosion. Besides, we identified developers involved in these discussions and conducted a survey with 10 participants and held interviews with 4 participants. Our findings show that: (1) developers either focus on the structural manifestation of architecture erosion or on its effect on run-time qualities, maintenance and evolution; (2) alongside technical factors, architecture erosion is caused to a large extent by non-technical factors; (3) despite the lack of dedicated tools for detecting architecture erosion, developers usually identify erosion through a number of symptoms; and (4) there are effective measures that can help to alleviate the impact of architecture erosion.</p><br><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9463012?casa_token=Q8U-IE9wEEgAAAAA:azoeTTjvF356EelBCdjDjQpnzpRuDhIuFPIYp5x1slO9wGQqZ2m7SG539qLDKe0W6Q2jpTYZN2qn">link</a><br></div><div class="paper-info"><h2>Título 195: A study on correlations between architectural smells and design patterns</h2><h3>Autores: ['Ilaria Pigazzini', 'Francesca Fontana', 'Bartosz Walter']</h3><h4>Ano: 2021</h4><p>Design patterns are recommended solutions for typical software design problems, with an extensively studied and documented impact on various quality factors. Flaws in design at a higher levels of abstraction are manifested in architectural smells. Some of those smells, similarly to code smells, can reduce the expected advantages of design patterns or even prevent their proper implementation. In this paper we study if and how design patterns and architectural smells are related, and how this knowledge could be exploited in practice. We present an empirical study with an analysis of 16 design patterns and 3 architectural smells in 60 open source Java systems. We analyze their diffuseness and correlation, and we extract association rules that describe their presence and dependencies. We demonstrate that there exist relationships between architectural smells and design patterns, both at the class and package levels. Some smells appear falsely positive, as they result from conscious decisions made by programmers, while the application of some patterns can be a cause of certain smells. Our results provide evidence that design patterns and architectural smells are related and affect each other.

Detection of architectural smells is paramount because they can seep through to design and implementation stages if left unidentified. Many architectural smells detection techniques and tools are proposed in the literature. The diversity in the detection techniques and tools suggests the need for their collective analysis to identify interesting aspects for practice and open research areas. To fulfill this, in this paper, we unify the knowledge about the detection of architectural smells through a systematic mapping study. We report on the existing detection techniques and tools for architectural smells to identify their limitations. We find there has been limited investigation of some architectural smells (e.g., micro-service smells); many architectural smells are not detected by tools yet; and there are limited empirical validations of techniques and tools. Based on our findings, we suggest several open research problems, including the need to (1) investigate undetected architectural smells (e.g., Java package smells), (2) improve the coverage of architectural smell detection across architecture styles (e.g., service-oriented and cloud), and (3) perform empirical validations of techniques and tools in industry across different languages and project domains.</p><br><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0164121220302752?casa_token=xtwQVx3XoEYAAAAA:YYXFoWAyg0KjVdl4GT8LgtiUME6CHUhar2zCx3rGT2mTGOILh26BGpLGVQ-Cru8b9Jqmm35v1z-G">link</a><br></div><div class="paper-info"><h2>Título 197: An Evolutionary Analysis of Software-Architecture Smells</h2><h3>Autores: ['Philipp Gnoyke', 'Sandro Schulze', 'Jacob Kr{\\"u}ger']</h3><h4>Ano: 2021</h4><p>If software quality assurance is postponed or even abandoned for a software system, maintenance and evolution become harder or even impossible.

In this paper, we present a study on the evolution of ASs as well as on how and when they foster system degradation. Thus, we provide valuable insights regarding what ASs are meaningful to assure system quality. To this end, we analyzed the evolution of three types of ASs in 14 open-source systems with a total of 485 versions. We adapted indicators used in previous studies to assess the severity of ASs (e.g., growth, lifetime), and relate ASs to technical debt as another established indicator. Our results indicate that 1) ASs remain mostly stable compared to the code size of a system, 2) certain types of ASs, such as cyclic dependencies, have a greater impact on system degradation, and 3) certain properties determine how much an AS contributes to software degradation.

These artefacts, if valuable and used more than once by the development organisation, can be seen as assets such as test cases, code, requirements, and documentation. As such, assets are often reused, updated, and become a base or even necessity for product development and evolution over time, constituting an investment. Assets are not well understood beyond code-based ones in the area of technical debt. Thus most asset types are often overlooked, and their state, which is subject to degradation over time, has not been much studied. Method: To address the problem, we conducted industrial focus groups with five companies and a literature review. The results were analysed qualitatively and summarised in a taxonomy. Results: We created a structured, extendable taxonomy of assets. The taxonomy contains 57 assets. Conclusions: The taxonomy serves as foundations for defining and identifying assets as a concept. It provides the foundation for studies into asset degradation and subsequent asset management. The taxonomy also includes code-based assets and thus can be helpful in further research into investigating degradation and debt concepts.</p><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.09884">link</a><br></div><div class="paper-info"><h2>Título 199: Detecting the Locations and Predicting the Costs of Compound Architectural Debts</h2><h3>Autores: ['Lu Xiao', 'Yuanfang Cai', 'Rick Kazman', 'Ran Mo', 'Qiong Feng']</h3><h4>Ano: 2021</h4><p>Architectural Technical Debt (ATD) refers to sub-optimal architectural design in a software system that incurs high maintenance ``interest" over time. Previous research revealed that ATD has significant negative impact on daily development. This paper contributes an approach to enable an architect to precisely locate ATDs, as well as capture the trajectory of maintenance cost on each debt, based on which, predict the cost of the debt in a future release. The ATDs are expressed in four typical patterns, which entail the core of each debt. Furthermore, we aggregate compound ATDs to capture the complicated relationship among multiple ATD instances, which should be examined together for effective refactoring solutions. We evaluate our approach on 18 real-world projects. We identified ATDs that persistently incur significant (up to 95% of) maintenance costs in most projects. The maintenance costs on the majority of debts fit into a linear regression model---indicating stable ``interest" rate. In five projects, 12.1% to 27.6% of debts fit into an exponential model, indicating increasing ``interest" rate, which deserve higher priority from architects. The regression models can accurately predict the costs of the majority of (82% to 100%) debts in the next release of a system. By aggregating related ATDs, architects can focus on a small number of cost-effective compound debts, which contain a relatively small number of source files, but account for a large portion of maintenance costs in their projects. With these capabilities, our approach can help architects make informed decisions regarding whether, where, and how to refactor for eliminating ATDs in their systems.</p><br><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9508122?casa_token=xCja3AuHxt4AAAAA:c4ngkl7xmV1SK5nOz-oZv8zi-Gr-h9TuAr9SCMhx-KFPKr4zzqD-PPT6Zxd6VDBaD6juizzXd2cV">link</a><br></div><div class="paper-info"><h2>Título 200: Identification and Measurement of Technical Debt Requirements in Software Development: a Systematic Literature Review</h2><h3>Autores: ['Ana Melo', 'Roberta Fagundes', 'Valentina Lenarduzzi', 'Wylliams Santos']</h3><h4>Ano: 2021</h4><p>Context: Technical Debt requirements are related to the distance between the ideal value of the specification and the system's actual implementation, which are consequences of strategic decisions for immediate gains, or unintended changes in context. To ensure the evolution of the software, it is necessary to keep it managed. Identification and measurement are the first two stages of the management process; however, they are little explored in academic research in requirements engineering. Objective: We aimed at investigating which evidence helps to strengthen the process of TD requirements management, including identification and measurement. Method: We conducted a Systematic Literature Review through manual and automatic searches considering 7499 studies from 2010 to 2020, and including 61 primary studies. Results: We identified some causes related to Technical Debt requirements, existing strategies to help in the identification and measurement, and metrics to support the measurement stage. Conclusion: Studies on TD requirements are still preliminary, especially on management tools. Yet, not enough attention is given to interpersonal issues, which are difficulties encountered when performing such activities, and therefore also require research. Finally, the provision of metrics to help measure TD is part of this work's contribution, providing insights into the application in the requirements context.</p><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.14232">link</a><br></div><div class="paper-info"><h2>Título 201: The Impact of Human Factors on Software Sustainability</h2><h3>Autores: ['Asif Imran', 'Tevfik Kosar']</h3><h4>Ano: 2021</h4><p>Software engineering is a constantly evolving subject area that faces new challenges every day as it tries to automate newer business processes. One of the key challenges to the success of a software solution is attaining sustainability. The inability of numerous software to sustain for the desired time length is caused by limited consideration given to sustainability during the stages of software development. This chapter presents a detailed and inclusive study covering human factor-related challenges of and approaches to software sustainability. Sustainability can be achieved by conducting specific activities at the human, environmental, and economic level. Human factors include critical social activities such as leadership and communication. This chapter groups the existing research efforts based on the above aspects. Next, how those aspects affect software sustainability is studied via a survey of software practitioners. Based on the findings, it was observed that human sustainability aspects are important, and that taking one into consideration and ignoring the other factors will threaten the sustainability of software products. Despite the noteworthy advantages of making a software sustainable, the research community has presented only a limited number of approaches that contribute to improving the human factors to achieve sustainability. To the best of our knowledge, these representations require further research. In this regard, an organized, structured, and detailed study is required on existing human factor-related sustainability approaches which will serve as a one-stop-service for researchers and software engineers who are willing to learn about these.</p><br><a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-69970-3_12">link</a><br></div><div class="paper-info"><h2>Título 202: On Microservice Analysis and Architecture Evolution: A Systematic Mapping Study</h2><h3>Autores: ['Vincent Bushong', 'Amr Abdelfattah', 'Abdullah Maruf', 'Dipta Das', 'Austin Lehman', 'Eric Jaroszewski', 'Michael Coffey', 'Tomas Cerny', 'Karel Frajtak', 'Pavel Tisnovsky', 'others']</h3><h4>Ano: 2021</h4><p>Microservice architecture has become the leading design for cloud-native systems.

With this new architecture, one can naturally expect a broad range of advancements and simplifications over legacy systems. However, microservice system design remains challenging, as it is still difficult for engineers to understand the system module boundaries. Thus, understanding and explaining the microservice systems might not be as easy as initially thought. This study aims to classify recently published approaches and techniques to analyze microservice systems. It also looks at the evolutionary perspective of such systems and their analysis. Furthermore, the identified approaches target various challenges and goals, which this study analyzed. Thus, it provides the reader with a roadmap to the discipline, tools, techniques, and open challenges for future work.

Code and design smells, such as the coupling smells examined in this article, are widely studied. Existing empirical studies reveal gaps between the scientific theory and practice, not yet explained by the scientific literature. Only basic coupling smell detection approaches and metrics seem to have been transferred to practice so far.

Objective:
This article aims to study the current practitioner’s understanding of coupling smells.

Method:
Based on grey literature sources containing practitioner views on coupling smells, we performed a Grounded Theory (GT) study. We used UML-based modeling to precisely encode our findings and performed a rigorous analysis of our codes and models.

Results:
Our results are defining factors of coupling smells, as well as smell impacts, trade-offs, relationships to other smells, relationships to practices and patterns, and fix options as perceived by practitioners. We further identified gaps in the understanding of coupling smells between science and practice, and derived opportunities and challenges for future scientific work.

In addition, more and more monolithic software systems have been migrated into a microservice architecture. The core idea is to decompose the concerns of software projects into small and loosely-coupled services. Each service is supposed to be developed and even managed independently, which in turn improving the efficiency of development and maintenance. Code clone is common during software implementations, and many prior studies have revealed that code clones could cause maintenance difficulties. However, there is little work exploring the impacts of code clones on microservice projects. To bridge this gap, we focus on exploring the existence and co-modifications of within-service and cross-service code clones. With our evaluation of eight microservice projects, we have presented that there still exist code clones within services or across services. In addition, both within-service and cross-service code clones have been involved in co-modifications, meaning that these clones have caused maintenance difficulties. Finally, we have explored the characteristics of co-modifications in terms of changed LOC for both within-service and cross-service code clones.</p><br><a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3475716.3475784">link</a><br></div><div class="paper-info"><h2>Título 205: Software product quality metrics: A systematic mapping study</h2><h3>Autores: ['Fatima Colakoglu', 'Ali Yazici', 'Alok Mishra']</h3><h4>Ano: 2021</h4><p>In the current competitive world, producing quality products has become a prominent factor to succeed in business.

Grey Literature (GL) recently has grown in Software Engineering (SE) research since the increased use of online communication channels by software engineers. However, there is still a limited understanding of how SE research is taking advantage of GL.

Objective:
This research aimed to understand how SE researchers use GL in their secondary studies.

Methods:
We conducted a tertiary study of studies published between 2011 and 2018 in high-quality software engineering conferences and journals. We then applied qualitative and quantitative analysis to investigate 446 potential studies.

Results:
From the 446 selected studies, 126 studies cited GL but only 95 of those used GL to answer a specific research question representing almost 21% of all the 446 secondary studies. Interestingly, we identified that few studies employed specific search mechanisms and used additional criteria for assessing GL. Moreover, by the time we conducted this research, 49% of the GL URLs are not working anymore. Based on our findings, we discuss some challenges in using GL and potential mitigation plans.

Conclusion:
In this paper, we summarized the last 10 years of software engineering research that uses GL, showing that GL has been essential for bringing practical new perspectives that are scarce in traditional literature. By drawing the current landscape of use, we also raise some awareness of related challenges (and strategies to deal with them).

In this work, we take one step further to explore the most problematic files (we define them as root files) in the architecture anti-patterns, which are potential causes leading to the difficulty of software maintenance. Using 45 Python projects as subjects, we investigate root files' maintainability, evolution (i.e., birth, living, and death), and their interactions in different architecture anti-patterns. Our results reveal that, compared with other files in anti-patterns, these root files take only a small proportion but incur heavy maintenance costs.

Unfortunately, systems tend to become strongly coupled over time, sometimes even exhibiting cyclic communication chains, making the individual deployment of services challenging. Such chains are highly problematic when strongly coupled communication e.g. based on synchronous invocations is used, but also create complexity and maintenance issues in more loosely coupled asynchronous or event-based communication. Here, cycles only manifest on a conceptual or domain level, making them hard to track for algorithms that rely solely on static analysis. Accordingly, previous attempts to detect cycles either focused on synchronous communication or had to collect additional runtime data, which can be costly and time-consuming. We suggest a novel approach for identifying and evaluating domain-based cyclic dependencies in microservice systems based on modular, reusable source code detectors. Based on the architecture model reconstructed by the detectors, we derived a set of architectural metrics for detecting and classifying domain-based cyclical dependencies. By conducting two case studies on open-source microservice architectures, we validated the feasibility and applicability of our approach.</p><br><a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-86044-8_15">link</a><br></div><div class="paper-info"><h2>Título 210: Architecture Style Selection using Statistics of Quality Attributes to Reduce Production Costs</h2><h3>Autores: ['Hamidreza Marzooni', 'Homayun Motameni', 'Ali Ebrahimnejad']</h3><h4>Ano: 2021</h4><br><a href="http://iajit.org/PDF/July%202021,%20No.%204/18933.pdf">link</a><br></div><div class="paper-info"><h2>Título 211: Agile elicitation of scalability requirements for open systems: A case study</h2><h3>Autores: ['Gunnar Brataas', 'Antonio Martini', 'Geir Hanssen', 'Georg R{\\ae}der']</h3><h4>Ano: 2021</h4><p>Eliciting scalability requirements during agile software development is complicated and poorly described in previous research. This article presents a lightweight artifact for eliciting scalability requirements during agile software development: the ScrumScale model. The ScrumScale model is a simple spreadsheet. The scalability concepts underlying the ScrumScale model are clarified in this design science research, which also utilizes coordination theory. This paper describes the open banking case study, in which a legacy banking system becomes open. This challenges the scalability of this legacy system. The first step in understanding this challenge is to elicit the new scalability requirements. In the open banking case study, key stakeholders from TietoEVRY spent 55 h eliciting the scalability requirements of TietoEVRY’s open banking project. According to TietoEVRY, the ScrumScale model provided a systematic way of producing scalability requirements. For TietoEVRY, the scalability concepts behind the ScrumScale model also offered significant advantages in dialogs with other stakeholders.</p><br><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0164121221001618">link</a><br></div><div class="paper-info"><h2>Título 212: Architecture violations detection and visualization in the continuous integration pipeline</h2><h3>Autores: ['Camilo Mendoza', "Jos{\\'e} Bocanegra", "Kelly Garc{\\'e}s", 'Rubby Casallas']</h3><h4>Ano: 2021</h4><p>New code in projects can introduce violations that deviate the code implementation from the intended architecture.

This data is presented in metric-centered views that help development teams to manage architecture erosion. Our approach is based on model-driven engineering techniques since models serve to represent the code, and a model-based pattern language helps us to automate the search for violation occurrences and execute corresponding actions (e.g., creation/assignment of issues). We confirm the approach benefits in a real project implemented by a software developing company, in a sample project available on the internet, and in a software development course, including 20 projects, where every single project decreases its architecture violations density through time.</p><br><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/spe.3004?casa_token=lT8DzEx4dDwAAAAA:QU0DD2_9iC-8uYXE0nAyAm7ImUdpxvl7X5ciRynekSkwrn7Kwfqmk-WXioZP9XbNLT2w4CDet6Ny0PubAQ">link</a><br></div><div class="paper-info"><h2>Título 213: Worst smells and their worst reasons</h2><h3>Autores: ['Davide Falessi', 'Rick Kazman']</h3><h4>Ano: 2021</h4><p>Code bad smells are symptoms of poor design and implementation. There are several well-known smell types, such as large classes (aka God classes), code clones, etc. and they have been shown to lead to technical debt and hence to decrease code maintainability. Quality gates are a recent technology that prevents the automatic acceptance of push requests of code commits that have been identified as containing certain smells. However, it is a challenging activity to decide which smells should be included in the quality gate, as developers may choose to optimize short term benefits like time to market over long term benefits like maintainability. But some smells appear to provide no benefit to developers whatsoever and hence such smells should always be avoided. The aims of this paper are: 1) to identify "worst smells", i.e., bad smells that never have a good reason to exist, 2) to determine the frequency, change-proneness, and severity associated with worst smells, and 3) to identify the "worst reasons", i.e., the reasons for introducing these worst smells in the first place. To achieve these aims we ran a survey with 71 developers. We learned that 80 out of 314 catalogued code smells are "worst"; that is, developers agreed that these 80 smells should never exist in any code base. We then checked the frequency and change-proneness of these worst smells on 27 large Apache open- source projects. Our results show insignificant differences, in both frequency and change proneness, between worst and non-worst smells. That is to say, these smells are just as damaging as other smells, but there is never any justifiable reason to introduce them. Finally, in follow-up phone interviews with five developers we confirmed that these smells are indeed worst, and the interviewees proposed seven reasons for why they may be introduced in the first place. By explicitly identifying these seven reasons, project stakeholders can, through quality gates or reviews, ensure that such smells are</p><br><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9462959?casa_token=FFPjy66OEwYAAAAA:Gl7fdmGcku9xtbXcgwmVXyY0_zbbwW9iBihUFmv6vXSVgMV5r_VdJsK0vDZTqQbgL7DX_HeML7Fy">link</a><br></div><div class="paper-info"><h2>Título 214: Systematically reviewing the layered architectural pattern principles and their use to reconstruct software architectures</h2><h3>Autores: ['Alvine Belle', 'Ghizlane Boussaidi', 'Timothy Lethbridge', 'Segla Kpodjedo', 'Hafedh Mili', 'Andres Paz']</h3><h4>Ano: 2021</h4><p>Architectural reconstruction is a reverse engineering activity aiming at recovering the missing decisions on a system. It can help identify the components, within a legacy software application, according to the application's architectural pattern. It is useful to identify architectural technical debt. We are interested in identifying layers within a layered application since the layered pattern is one of the most used patterns to structure large systems. Earlier component reconstruction work focusing on that pattern relied on generic component identification criteria, such as cohesion and coupling. Recent work has identified architectural-pattern specific criteria to identify components within that pattern. However, the architectural-pattern specific criteria that the layered pattern embodies are loosely defined. In this paper, we present a first systematic literature review (SLR) of the literature aiming at inventorying such criteria for layers within legacy applications and grouping them under four principles that embody the fundamental design principles under-lying the architectural pattern. We identify six such criteria in the form of design rules. We also perform a second systematic literature review to synthesize the literature on software architecture reconstruction in the light of these criteria.

However, little is known about the relations between the effects of TD and TD payment practices. Having this knowledge can provide valuable information for decision making about which payment practice can be applied given the presence of specific effects of TD. Aims: To investigate, from the point of view of software practitioners, (i) which TD payment practices have been used when certain effects of the presence of debt are felt in software projects and (ii) the reasons for not paying debt items despite the effects they are causing to the project. Method: We analyze quantitatively and qualitatively data collected from a survey with 432 practitioners across four countries. Results: Among the identified relations, the practice "code refactoring" is commonly used to pay debt items off when the effects "delivery delay" and "rework" are felt in software projects. On the other hand, when practitioners face the TD effects "low external quality" and "delivery delay", ,they commonly justify the non- payment of the debt items indicating the need of "focusing on short term goals".

Like with traditional software, Technical Debt (TD) will emerge naturally over time in these systems, therefore leading to challenges and risks if not managed appropriately. The influence of data science and the stochastic nature of AI-based systems may also lead to new types of TD or antipatterns, which are not yet fully understood by researchers and practitioners.

It is important to manage these technical debt items, as not all of them need to be paid. Having a list of prioritized debts is an essential step in decision-making in the management process. This work aims at finding technical debt prioritization methods, providing a classification of them. That is, methods to identify whether and when a technical debt should be paid off. We performed a systematic mapping review to find and analyze the main papers of the area, covering the main bases. We selected 112 studies, resulting in 51 unique papers. We classified the methods in a two-level taxonomy containing 10 categories according to their different possible outcomes. In addition, we have identified three methods results: boolean, category and ordered list. Finally, we have also identified practical technical characteristics and requirements for a method to prioritize technical debt items in real projects. Although several methods have been found in literature, none of them are adaptive to the context and are language-independent, nor cover several technical debt types. Moreover, there is a clear lack of tools to use them. So, in conclusion, the research on technical debt prioritization is still wide open.

Objective: This work investigates the current state of the art of technical debt tools by identifying which activities, functionalities and kind of technical debt are handled by existing tools that support the technical debt management in software projects.

Conclusions: Our study identified 50 TD tools where 42 of them are new tools, and 8 tools extend an existing one. Most of the tools address technical debt related to code, design, and/or architecture artifacts. Besides, the different TD management activities received different levels of attention. For example, TD identification is supported by 80% of the tools, whereas 30% of them handle the TD documentation activity.

Objective: This paper investigates the most commonly used practices to pay off TD and to prevent debt occurrence in software projects from the architect’s point of view. Method: We used the available data from InsighTD, which is a globally distributed family of industrial surveys on the causes, effects, and management of TD. We analyze responses from a corpus of 72 software architects from Brazil, Chile, Colombia, and the United States. Results: Results showed that refactoring (30.2%) was the main practice related to TD payment, followed by design improvements (14.0%). Refactoring, design improvements, and test improvements are the most cited payment practices among cases of code, design and test debt. Concerning the TD preventive practices, we find that having a well-defined architecture and design is the most cited practice (13.6%), followed by having a well-defined scope and requirements. This last practice is the most cited one for expert software architects. Finally, when comparing preventive practices among the three major roles derived from the survey (software architects, engineer roles, and management roles), we found that none of the roles shared the most cited practice, meaning that each role had its worries and focus on different strategies to reduce TD’s presence in the software.

Software companies need to manage and refactor Technical Debt issues. Therefore, it is necessary to understand if and when refactoring of Technical Debt should be prioritized with respect to developing features or fixing bugs.

Objective
The goal of this study is to investigate the existing body of knowledge in software engineering to understand what Technical Debt prioritization approaches have been proposed in research and industry.

Method
We conducted a Systematic Literature Review of 557 unique papers published until 2020, following a consolidated methodology applied in software engineering. We included 44 primary studies.

Results
Different approaches have been proposed for Technical Debt prioritization, all having different goals and proposing optimization regarding different criteria. The proposed measures capture only a small part of the plethora of factors used to prioritize Technical Debt qualitatively in practice. We present an impact map of such factors. However, there is a lack of empirical and validated set of tools.

Conclusion
We observed that Technical Debt prioritization research is preliminary and there is no consensus on what the important factors are and how to measure them. Consequently, we cannot consider current research conclusive. In this paper, we therefore outline different directions for necessary future investigations.

Architectural technical debt in software-intensive systems is a metaphor used to describe the “big” design decisions (e.g., choices regarding structure, frameworks, technologies, languages, etc.) that, while being suitable or even optimal when made, significantly hinder progress in the future. While other types of debt, such as code-level technical debt, can be readily detected by static analyzers, and often be refactored with minimal or only incremental efforts, architectural debt is hard to be identified, of wide-ranging remediation cost, daunting, and often avoided.

In this study, we aim at developing a better understanding of how software development organizations conceptualize architectural debt, and how they deal with it. In order to do so, in this investigation we apply a mixed empirical method, constituted by a grounded theory study followed by focus groups. With the grounded theory method we construct a theory on architectural technical debt by eliciting qualitative data from software architects and senior technical staff from a wide range of heterogeneous software development organizations. We applied the focus group method to evaluate the emerging theory and refine it according to the new data collected.

The result of the study, i.e., a theory emerging from the gathered data, constitutes an encompassing conceptual model of architectural technical debt, identifying and relating concepts such as its symptoms, causes, consequences, management strategies, and communication problems. From the conducted focus groups, we assessed that the theory adheres to the four evaluation criteria of classic grounded theory, i.e., the theory fits its underlying data, is able to work, has relevance, and is modifiable as new data appears.

By grounding the findings in empirical evidence, the theory provides researchers and practitioners with novel knowledge on the crucial factors of architectural technical debt experienced in industrial contexts.</p><br><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0164121221000224">link</a><br></div><div class="paper-info"><h2>Título 225: Architectural Technical Debt of Multiagent Systems Development Platforms</h2><h3>Autores: ['Ilaria Pigazzini', 'Daniela Briola', 'Francesca Fontana']</h3><h4>Ano: 2021</h4><p>Technical debt is candidate to be the next buzzword in software engineering, and the number of studies evaluating the technical debt of software projects is increasing. A particular and dangerous type of debt is the architectural debt, i.e., the consequences of sub-optimal design decisions. Currently, there are no studies about the evaluation of architectural debt in MultiAgent Systems (MAS) and platforms. Hence, in this paper we propose the analysis of four well-known MAS development platforms, with the aim of evaluating their architectural debt and open the discussion in this field. We exploit a tool, named Arcan, developed for architectural smell detection and for the computation of an architectural debt index. The results show that MAS development platforms are subjected to architectural debt, and in particular to the presence of Cyclic Dependency smells.

Method: We conducted a quantitative and qualitative case study of a project with approximately 1000 microservices in a large, international financing services company. We measured and compared the number of software incidents of different categories before and after repaying ATD. Results: The total number of incidents was reduced by 84%, and the numbers of critical- and high-priority incidents were both reduced by approximately 90% after the architectural refactoring. The number of incidents in the architecture with the ATD was mainly constant over time, but we observed a slight increase of low priority incidents related to inaccessibility and the environment in the architecture without the ATD. Conclusion: This study shows evidence that refactoring ATDs, such as lack of communication standards, poor management of dead-letter queues, and the use of inadequate technologies in microservices, reduces the number of critical- and high-priority incidents and, thus, part of its interest, although some low priority incidents may increase.</p><br><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9582573?casa_token=KA6SfMm6cYYAAAAA:t_f37mjCQWfC2A0_2UED-RmdWU1SeFmkSigPRUuN8sHN4N1cFVIGq2yM22PqXhdRwFzCrKB4xs53">link</a><br></div><div class="paper-info"><h2>Título 228: ATDx: A tool for providing a data-driven overview of architectural technical debt in software-intensive systems</h2><h3>Autores: ['Sebastian Ospina', 'Roberto Verdecchia', 'Ivano Malavolta', 'Patricia Lago']</h3><h4>Ano: 2021</h4><p>Architectural technical debt (ATD) in software-intensive systems is mostly invisible to software developers, can be widespread throughout entire code-bases, and its remediation cost is often steep.

ATDx is an approach designed to provide a data-driven, intuitive, and actionable overview of the ATD present in a portfolio of software projects. ATDx is based on third-party source code analysis tools, architectural issue severity calculation via clustering, and aggregation of measurements into different architectural technical debt dimensions. The ATDx tool allows users to automatically run the ATDx analysis, generate reports containing the ATDx analysis results, and is integrated with GitHub. In addition to the tool, we provide two already implemented plugins, allowing users to run the ATDx tool out-of-the-box.

We present a summary of current understanding of the technical debt concept and propose a broader application of the approach at a system level. The technical debt metaphor provides a method to identify cases when design or implementation decisions are being made for expediency and assess their long term impact on productivity and risk. In addition, technical debt management offers a logical approach to tracking expedient decisions and determining when it makes sense to carry the debt and when it's better to pay it off by updating designed and retrofitting units. In this paper, we describe various kinds of technical debt that may be present in a system baseline and consider how the presence of debt impacts further evolution of the system. Types of debt include architectural debt, configuration debt, testing debt and deprecation debt among others.

These have serious impact on the quality of a software system, and can cost significant time and effort to be changed. While current research efforts have explored general concepts of architectural design decisions and technical debt separately, debt-incurring architectural design decisions have not been specifically explored in practice. Objective: In this case study, we explore debt-incurring architectural design decisions (DADDs) in practice. Specifically, we explore the main types of DADDs, why and how they are incurred in a software system, and how practitioners deal with these types of design decisions. Method: We performed interviews and a focus group with practitioners working in embedded and enterprise software companies, discussing their concrete experience with such architectural design decisions. Results: We provide the following contributions: 1) A categorization for the types of DADDs, which extend a current ontology on architectural design decisions. 2) A process on how deliberate DADDs are made in practice. 3) A conceptual model which shows the relationships between the causes and triggers of inadvertent DADDs. 4) The main factors that influence the way of dealing with DADDs.</p><br><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0950584921001282">link</a><br></div><div class="paper-info"><h2>Título 233: Technical Debt Impacting Lead-Times: An Exploratory Study</h2><h3>Autores: ['Valentina Lenarduzzi', 'Antonio Martini', 'Nyyti Saarim{\\"a}ki', 'Damian Tamburri']</h3><h4>Ano: 2021</h4><p>Background: Technical Debt is a consolidated notion in software engineering research and practice.

The increasingly rapid pace of innovations in mechatronic systems triggers decisions being taken under time and cost pressure. At times, compromises in technical solutions are made, neglecting their long-term damage to the system. Technical debt (TD), a concept from software engineering, refers to short-term benefits that lead to long-term negative consequences, e.g., in the form of more difficult maintainability or evolvability. This also applies to mechatronic systems, yet the knowledge of TD characteristics and correlations in the interdisciplinary life cycle has only received little attention. This first comprehensive survey investigates TD in mechatronics systematically and across sectors. 50 experts, of whom 42% hold positions as department heads, from 21 renowned companies and 10 sectors in the German-speaking region supported this study with real scenarios where TD caused damage to their system. 94 informative TD incidents that were classified into twelve TD types were recorded, of which 2/3 have not yet been eliminated and posed a potential risk to the system. TD emerges most frequently in the first three stages of the life cycle, where the consequences rarely remain isolated at their source but are forwarded to later phases and disciplines in the life cycle. In contrast to the research focus in software engineering, the multi-domain analysis of mechatronic TD issues reveals that software engineers are most burdened by Requirements TD and Infrastructure TD in the interdisciplinary environment.</p><br><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0164121220302119">link</a><br></div><div class="paper-info"><h2>Título 235: The perception of Architectural Smells in industrial practice</h2><h3>Autores: ['Darius Sas', 'Ilaria Pigazzini', 'Paris Avgeriou', 'Francesca Fontana']</h3><h4>Ano: 2021</h4><p>Architectural technical debt (TD) is the most significant type of TD in industrial practice.

This can be attributed to various reasons such as heavy workload, tight delivery schedule, or developers’ lack of experience. Since a software system grows mostly through the addition of new code, it is interesting to study how TD fluctuates along this process. Specifically, in this paper, we investigate: (a) the temporality of code TD introduction in new code, i.e., whether the introduction of TD is stable across the lifespan of the project, or if its evolution presents spikes; and (b) the relation of TD introduction to the development team’s workload in a given period, as well as to the experience of the development team. To answer these questions, we have performed a case study on 47 open-source projects from two well-known ecosystems (Apache and Eclipse) as well as additional isolated projects from GitHub (not selected from a specific ecosystem) and inspected the number of TD issues introduced in 6-month sliding temporal windows.

In many autonomous teams this technical debt will damage and injure the process, prohibiting them from adding new functionalities to their products. Tech companies must therefore understand how they can manage TD to avoid getting stuck fixing bad code. In the research on technical debt management (TDM), there seems to be a lack of empirical studies that examine how TD is managed in autonomous teams. Some frameworks are developed with the purpose of investigating TDM but lack the empirical validation and reliability.
This study investigates how autonomous teams actively manage technical debt, by conducting a multiple-case study in a Norwegian fintech company. The teams are studied by utilizing the TDM framework, measuring autonomous teams’ degree of maturity within different TDM activities in order to understand their current state of practice and how to further improve these.
The study found that all autonomous teams practiced TDM, but to various extents. Some teams had structured processes, while others had no clear strategies. Most of the teams were ranked with what the framework call “received level of maturity”, and conducted TDM activities occasionally based on their current needs. The study also found challenges related to the TDM frameworks maturity levels relation to TDM success, and identified that TDM activities ranked as highly mature did not necessarily translate into higher TDM success.
The study identified a need for the TDM framework to be further empirically tested and iterated on for it to work as a an accurate tool for understanding and improving autonomous teams’ TDM processes.</p><br><a href="https://kristiania.brage.unit.no/kristiania-xmlui/handle/11250/2826958">link</a><br></div><div class="paper-info"><h2>Título 239: Technical Debt predictive model through Temporal Convolutional Network</h2><h3>Autores: ['Lerina Aversano', 'Mario Bernardi', 'Marta Cimitile', 'Martina Iammarino']</h3><h4>Ano: 2021</h4><p>Technical debt is a metaphor that refers to all the consequences of poorly written code and trade-offs in development.

Objectives: In the context of microservices applications, this paper aims to identify architectural technical debts (ATDs), their costs, and their most common solutions. Method: We conducted an exploratory multiple case study by conducting 25 interviews with practitioners working with microservices in seven large companies. Results: We found 16 ATD issues, their negative impact (interest), and common solutions to repay each debt together with the related costs (principal). Two examples of critical ATD issues found were the use of shared databases that, if not properly planned, leads to potential breaks on services every time the database schema changes and bad API designs, which leads to coupling among teams. We identified ATDs occurring in different domains and stages of development and created a map of the relationships among those debts.

They are often contracted due to tight project deadlines, for example quick fixes and workarounds, and can make future changes more costly or impossible. TD prevention should be more important than TD repayment, because subsequent refactoring and reengineering is usually more expensive than building the right solution from the beginning. While there are numerous works on TD repayment, solutions for TD prevention are understudied. This paper evaluates a framework that focuses on both TD prevention and TD repayment. It was developed by and applied in an IT unit of a publishing house. The unique contribution of this framework is the integration of TD management into project management. The evaluation was carried out by a study based on ticket statistics and a structured survey with participants from the observed IT unit and a comparison unit. The evaluation shows that the adoption of this framework leads to a raised awareness for the contraction of TD. This results in benefits like more rational discussions and decisions, TD prevention and timelier repayment of TD tickets.</p><br><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9462991?casa_token=8YyBz4tlInoAAAAA:DcNiPAdpD4tjOKWqYe5O-UL-UNeccfzErheeEvGcLpZSEbm1mLqyEP-kHW07kQ_rJt6Cq_OL0mKr">link</a><br></div><div class="paper-info"><h2>Título 243: Exploring the Tensions Between Management of Architectural Debt and Digital Innovation: The Case of a Financial Organization</h2><h3>Autores: ['Knut-H Rolland', 'Kalle Lyytinen']</h3><h4>Ano: 2021</h4><p>The metaphor Technical Debt describes the consequences of taking shortcuts in the software development process for short-term benefit, at the expense of higher maintenance in the future.

The final model used 8 metrics as input and had a total success rate of 80% when comparing the model’s ranking with mutual opinion of the developers. The dashboard was seen to be a useful tool for discussion and a quick way to identify areas in the code with Technical Debt. It was also discovered that measuring Technical Debt with only software metrics is a hard to impossible task, and many sources of information must be used in conjunction.

The bad smell is an imperfect solution in the software system that negatively impacts the internal software quality and maintainability. In this paper, we will study five open-source software projects (OSSPs) that have several releases and also estimate the numbers of architecture smells (ASs), design smells (DSs), and code smells (CSs) for every release. Designite will be used to detect smells. We describe a case study conducted to explore the following: (1) What is the average smells density for architecture, design, and code smells in an OSSP? (2) Does the density of each smell type increase over multiple releases? (3) What percentage of each smell-type density is eliminated by refactoring? We collected around 2 million LOC from five OSSPs that have multiple releases from the GitHub repository to statistically analyze the software concerning the smells as indicators of TD. We find 36% of Architecture Technical Debt (ATD) is Cyclic Dependency, while 33% of Design Debt (DD) is Cyclically-dependent Modularization. More than 70% of Code Debt (CD) is Magic Number. Even though the developers do refactoring between releases, the TD density in general increases.

The technical debt (TD) metaphor describes actions made during various stages of software development that lead to a more costly future regarding system maintenance and evolution. According to recent studies, on average 25% of development effort is spent, i.e. wasted, on TD caused issues in software development organizations. However, further research is needed to investigate the relations between various software development activities and TD.

Objective:
The objective of this study is twofold. First, to get empirical insight on the understanding and the use of the TD concept in the IT industry. Second, to contribute towards precise conceptualization of the TD concept through analysis of causes and effects.

Method:
In order to address the research objective a family of surveys was designed as a part of an international initiative that congregates researchers from 12 countries—InsighTD. At country level, national teams ran survey replications with industry practitioners from the respective countries.

Results:
In total 653 valid responses were collected from 6 countries. Regarding the prevalence of the TD concept 22% of practitioners have only theoretical knowledge about it, and 47% have some practical experiences with TD identification or management. Further analysis indicated that senior practitioners who work in larger organizations, larger teams, and on larger systems are more likely to be experienced with TD management. Time pressure or deadlinewas the single most cited cause of TD. Regarding the effects of TD: delivery delay, low maintainability, and rework were the most cited.

Conclusion:
InsighTD is the first family of surveys on technical debt in software engineering. It provided a methodological framework that allowed multiple replication teams to conduct research activities and to contribute to a single dataset. Future work will focus on more specific aspects of TD management.</p><br><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0164121221002119?casa_token=4YsywfFJGLcAAAAA:wpXNvNsLv8D1PRGdG50ecrLESx8GKZ9xkEU9CGcva9W-Cd_S5GKVlyV4OndAR-RTs33ddpB0eTR-">link</a><br></div><div class="paper-info"><h2>Título 250: DebtFree: Minimizing Labeling Cost in Self-Admitted Technical Debt Identification using Semi-Supervised Learning</h2><h3>Autores: ['Huy Tu', 'Tim Menzies']</h3><h4>Ano: 2022</h4><p>Keeping track of and managing Self-Admitted Technical Debts (SATDs) is important for maintaining a healthy software project. Current active-learning SATD recognition tool involves manual inspection of 24% of the test comments on average to reach 90% of the recall. Among all the test comments, about 5% are SATDs. The human experts are then required to read almost a quintuple of the SATD comments which indicates the inefficiency of the tool. Plus, human experts are still prone to error: 95% of the false-positive labels from previous work were actually true positives.
To solve the above problems, we propose DebtFree, a two-mode framework based on unsupervised learning for identifying SATDs. In mode1, when the existing training data is unlabeled, DebtFree starts with an unsupervised learner to automatically pseudo-label the programming comments in the training data. In contrast, in mode2 where labels are available with the corresponding training data, DebtFree starts with a pre-processor that identifies the highly prone SATDs from the test dataset. Then, our machine learning model is employed to assist human experts in manually identifying the remaining SATDs. Our experiments on 10 software projects show that both models yield a statistically significant improvement in effectiveness over the state-of-the-art automated and semi-automated models. Specifically, DebtFree can reduce the labeling effort by 99% in mode1 (unlabeled training data), and up to 63% in mode2 (labeled training data) while improving the current active learner's F1 relatively to almost 100%.</p><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.10592">link</a><br></div><div class="paper-info"><h2>Título 251: Empirical evaluation of an architectural technical debt index in the context of the Apache and ONAP ecosystems</h2><h3>Autores: ['Roberto Verdecchia', 'Ivano Malavolta', 'Patricia Lago', 'Ipek Ozkaya']</h3><h4>Ano: 2022</h4><p>Background Architectural Technical Debt (ATD) in a software-intensive system denotes architectural design choices which, while being suitable or even optimal when adopted, lower the maintainability and evolvability of the system in the long term, hindering future development activities. Despite the growing research interest in ATD, how to gain an informative and encompassing viewpoint of the ATD present in a software-intensive system is still an open problem. Objective In this study, we evaluate ATDx, a data-driven approach providing an overview of the ATD present in a software-intensive system. The approach, based on the analysis of a software portfolio, calculates severity levels of architectural rule violations via a clustering algorithm, and aggregates results into different ATD dimensions. Method To evaluate ATDx, we implement an instance of the approach based on SonarQube, and run the analysis on the Apache and ONAP ecosystems. The analysis results are then shared with the portfolio contributors, who are invited to participate in an online survey designed to evaluate the representativeness and actionability of the approach. Results The survey results confirm the representativeness of the ATDx, in terms of both the ATDx analysis results and the used architectural technical debt dimensions. Results also showed the actionability of the approach, although to a lower extent when compared to the ATDx representativeness, with usage scenarios including refactoring, code review, communication, and ATD evolution analysis. Conclusions With ATDx, we strive for the establishment of a sound, comprehensive, and intuitive architectural view of the ATD identifiable via source code analysis. The collected results are promising, and display both the representativeness and actionability of the approach.

SATD enables practitioners to take some temporary solutions instead of making comprehensive decisions, which will lead to the high complexity of the software. However, most existing studies relied on manual methods for detecting SATDs. A recent study proposed a method HATD that used a hybrid attention-based method to automatically detect SATDs and it achieved the state-of-the-art performance. However, HATD mainly focused on the locality of the comment instances and lacked of the relationship between long-distance and discontinuous comment instances. To address such an issue, in this work, we propose a novel approach named GGSATD. Specifically, GGSATD first builds the graph for comment instances and then employs the gated graph neural network to iteratively update node representation. The global representation can be obtained by the soft attention mechanism and pooling operation. Experiments on 10 projects show that our GGSATD method obtains promising performance against five baseline methods in both within-project and cross-project scenarios. Extended experiments on seven real-world projects illustrate the effectiveness of our GGSATD method.</p><br><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0164121222000036?casa_token=RCzeTiTv4msAAAAA:U8uEbp6Ir9WXUXP2qc33K5QgJpxAPknexZwDgIT03YOO-s3__bZrohqXYkWV8DBSfvhxFJvuqLpQ">link</a><br></div><div class="paper-info"><h2>Título 253: Technical debt resulting from architectural degradation and code smells: a systematic mapping study</h2><h3>Autores: ['Dipta Das', 'Abdullah Maruf', 'Rofiqul Islam', 'Noah Lambaria', 'Samuel Kim', 'Amr Abdelfattah', 'Tomas Cerny', 'Karel Frajtak', 'Miroslav Bures', 'Pavel Tisnovsky']</h3><h4>Ano: 2022</h4><p>Poor design choices, bad coding practices, or the need to produce software quickly can stand behind technical debt. Unfortunately, manually identifying and managing technical debt gets more difficult as the software matures. Recent research offers various techniques to automate the process of detecting and managing technical debt to address these challenges. This manuscript presents a mapping study of the many aspects of technical debt that have been discovered in this field of study. This includes looking at the various forms of technical debt, as well as detection methods, the financial implications, and mitigation strategies. The findings and outcomes of this study are applicable to a wide range of software development life-cycle decisions.</p><br><a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3512753.3512755">link</a><br></div><div class="paper-info"><h2>Título 254: Relationships between software architecture and source code in practice: An exploratory survey and interview</h2><h3>Autores: ['Fangchao Tian', 'Peng Liang', 'Muhammad Babar']</h3><h4>Ano: 2022</h4><p>Context
Software Architecture (SA) and Source Code (SC) are two intertwined artefacts that represent the interdependent design decisions made at different levels of abstractions - High-Level (HL) and Low-Level (LL). An understanding of the relationships between SA and SC is expected to bridge the gap between SA and SC for supporting maintenance and evolution of software systems.

Objective
We aimed at exploring practitioners’ understanding about the relationships between SA and SC.

Method
We used a mixed-method that combines an online survey with 87 respondents and an interview with 8 participants to collect the views of practitioners from 37 countries about the relationships between SA and SC.

Results
Our results reveal that: practitioners mainly discuss five features of relationships between SA and SC; a few practitioners have adopted dedicated approaches and tools in the literature for identifying and analyzing the relationships between SA and SC despite recognizing the importance of such information for improving a system's quality attributes, especially maintainability and reliability. It is felt that cost and effort are the major impediments that prevent practitioners from identifying, analyzing, and using the relationships between SA and SC.

Conclusions
The results have empirically identified five features of relationships between SA and SC reported in the literature from the perspective of practitioners and a systematic framework to manage the five features of relationships should be developed with dedicated approaches and tools considering the cost and benefit of maintaining the relationships.</p><br><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0950584921001580?casa_token=pXCU-GXpXkgAAAAA:n_F_fP7fDuZxcXadzYaJNA3TA3VroP92eZ-k0RAc6qCk9iKKT26z8-gOOzW4LZYP4ECigO2rd5Ls">link</a><br></div><div class="paper-info"><h2>Título 255: Accumulation and prioritization of Architectural Debt in three companies migrating to microservices</h2><h3>Autores: ['Saulo De Toledo', 'Antonio Martini', 'Phu Nguyen', 'Dag Sj{\\o}berg']</h3><h4>Ano: 2022</h4><p>Many companies migrate to microservices because they help deliver value to customers quickly and continuously. However, like any architectural style, microservices are prone to architectural technical debt (ATD), which can be costly if the debts are not timely identified, avoided, or removed. During the early stages of migration, microservice-specific ATDs may accumulate. For example, practitioners may decide to continue using poorly defined APIs in microservices while attempting to maintain compatibility with old functionalities. The riskiest ATDs must be prioritized. Nevertheless, there is limited research regarding the prioritization of ATDs in companies migrating to microservices. This study aims to identify, during migration, which microservice-specific ATDs occur, are the most severe, and are the most challenging to solve. In addition, we propose a way to prioritize these debts. We conducted a multiple exploratory case study of three large companies that were early in the migration process to microservices. We interviewed 47 practitioners with several roles to identify the debts in their contexts.We report the ATDs detected during migration, the ATDs that practitioners estimate to occur in the future, and the ATDs that practitioners report as difficult to solve. We discuss the results in the context of the companies involved in this study. In addition, we used a risk assessment approach to propose a way for prioritizing ATDs. Practitioners from other organizations and researchers may use this approach to provide rankings to help identify and prioritize which ATDs should be avoided or solved in their contexts.</p><br><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9732968">link</a><br></div><div class="paper-info"><h2>Título 256: Characterizing the architectural erosion metrics: A systematic mapping study</h2><h3>Autores: ['Ahmed Baabad', 'Hazura Zulzalil', 'Salmi Baharom', 'others']</h3><h4>Ano: 2022</h4><p>Software architecture is crucial in determining success or failure in a variety of software development and design fields. Typically, as a system evolves, software architecture deteriorates. This phenomenon is known as architectural erosion. Several studies have addressed architectural erosion based on different solutions. As a result, the metrics technique is the most prevalent solution for architectural erosion. Nevertheless, a comprehensive description of architectural erosion metrics remains unorganized and scattered. This work aims to conduct a systematic mapping to describe and analyze the architectural erosion metrics to provide an overview of erosion metrics and their current trends. Furthermore, no systematic attempts have been made on architectural erosion metrics. The final samples of this study were specified as a total of 43 included papers. Nearly 100 architectural erosion metrics were found. We proposed nine classifications to address architectural erosion challenges, based on adopted approaches in primary studies. The metrics of architectural erosion provide strong evidence for identifying decay and a rapid enabler factor for the adoption of numerous metrics mechanisms to address architectural erosion. The classification of metrics, which is the first of its kind, benefits researchers and practitioners. However, it can be concluded that various aspects are still ambiguous and require further research on architectural erosion measures.</p><br><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9709798">link</a><br></div><div class="paper-info"><h2>Título 257: Automatic Detection and Analysis of Technical Debts in Peer-Review Documentation of R Packages</h2><h3>Autores: ['Junaed Khan', 'Gias Uddin']</h3><h4>Ano: 2022</h4><p>Technical debt (TD) is a metaphor for code-related problems that arise as a result of prioritizing speedy delivery over perfect code. Given that the reduction of TDs can have long-term positive impact in the software engineering life-cycle (SDLC), TDs are studied extensively in the literature. However, very few of the existing research focused on the technical debts of R programming language despite its popularity and usage. Recent research by Codabux et al. [21] finds that R packages can have 10 diverse TD types analyzing peer-review documentation. However, the findings are based on the manual analysis of a small sample of R package review comments. In this paper, we develop a suite of Machine Learning (ML) classifiers to detect the 10 TDs automatically. The best performing classifier is based on the deep ML model BERT, which achieves F1-scores of 0.71 - 0.91. We then apply the trained BERT models on all available peer-review issue comments from two platforms, rOpenSci and BioConductor (13.5K review comments coming from a total of 1297 R packages). We conduct an empirical study on the prevalence and evolution of 10 TDs in the two R platforms. We discovered documentation debt is the most prevalent among all types of TD, and it is also expanding rapidly. We also find that R packages of generic platform (i.e. rOpenSci) are more prone to TD compared to domain-specific platform (i.e. BioConductor). Our empirical study findings can guide future improvements opportunities in R package documentation. Our ML models can be used to automatically monitor the prevalence and evolution of TDs in R package documentation.</p><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.04241">link</a><br></div><div class="paper-info"><h2>Título 258: BARRIERS AND ENABLERS OF DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION: AN EXPLORATORY ANALYSIS OF DIGITAL DEBT AND DEVOPS</h2><h3>Autores: ['Thiago Oliveira']</h3><h4>Ano: 2022</h4><p>The rapid diffusion of digital technologies, combined with a large amount of data generated by interactions between users and organizations, has led to the reinvention of the way in which markets develop and improve their business models. It is not uncommon to hear that every company is a technology company. However, this status cannot be achieved quickly as it requires the development of organizational resources and capabilities, in addition to a new digital mindset to produce a strategy capable of overcoming its internal barriers and leveraging the enablers of this transformation. Incumbent and established organizations present barriers to their digital transformation when facing constraints from their legacy systems with their needs for modernization or even replacement. Furthermore, the pressure to deliver new business value propositions forces sub-optimal technical decisions that take a toll on product quality and the flexibility of the solutions. This accumulation of deficiencies in the organization's technological portfolio promotes digital debt with its customers, undermining its value proposition. In view of this, new philosophies, such as DevOps, have been emerging to ensure a cycle of continuous improvement, increase productivity, address product quality issues, change the culture, and adopt new approaches to deliver digital products. This exploratory study presents evidence that digital debt and DevOps act, respectively, as a barrier and enabler of the organization's digital maturity, promoting a discussion about their prioritization in the organization's digital business strategy. A proposal for deepening the academic field is also presented.</p><br><a href="https://bibliotecadigital.fgv.br/dspace/handle/10438/31774">link</a><br></div><div class="paper-info"><h2>Título 259: Understanding software architecture erosion: A systematic mapping study</h2><h3>Autores: ['Ruiyin Li', 'Peng Liang', 'Mohamed Soliman', 'Paris Avgeriou']</h3><h4>Ano: 2022</h4><p>Architecture erosion (AEr) can adversely affect software development and has received significant attention in the last decade. However, there is an absence of a comprehensive understanding of the state of research about the reasons and consequences of AEr, and the countermeasures to address AEr. This work aims at systematically investigating, identifying, and analyzing the reasons, consequences, and ways of detecting and handling AEr. With 73 studies included, the main results are as follows: (1) AEr manifests not only through architectural violations and structural issues but also causing problems in software quality and during software evolution; (2) non-technical reasons that cause AEr should receive the same attention as technical reasons, and practitioners should raise awareness of the grave consequences of AEr, thereby taking actions to tackle AEr-related issues; (3) a spectrum of approaches, tools, and measures has been proposed and employed to detect and tackle AEr; and (4) three categories of difficulties and five categories of lessons learned on tackling AEr were identified. The results can provide researchers a comprehensive understanding of AEr and help practitioners handle AEr and improve the sustainability of their architecture. More empirical studies are required to investigate the practices of detecting and addressing AEr in industrial settings.</p><br><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/smr.2423?casa_token=fkE2ddqCGpoAAAAA:4IC53TQC5qdwG7xD6jl5EYqrHbEIlqkuR51l-7PCkBB0ZebejCMcpQvLqdEfOuh-MkXZXpWTR8nHUyaCHA">link</a><br></div><div class="paper-info"><h2>Título 260: On the evolution and impact of Architectural Smells--An industrial case study</h2><h3>Autores: ['Darius Sas', 'Paris Avgeriou', 'Umut Uyumaz']</h3><h4>Ano: 2022</h4><p>Architectural smells (AS) are notorious for their long-term impact on the Maintainability and Evolvability of software systems. The majority of research work has investigated this topic by mining software repositories of open source Java systems, making it hard to generalise and apply them to an industrial context and other programming languages. To address this research gap, we conducted an embedded multiple-case case study, in collaboration with a large industry partner, to study how AS evolve in industrial embedded systems. We detect and track AS in 9 C/C++ projects with over 30 releases for each project that span over two years of development, with over 20 millions lines of code in the last release only. In addition to these quantitative results, we also interview 12 among the developers and architects working on these projects, collecting over six hours of qualitative data about the usefulness of AS analysis and the issues they experienced while maintaining and evolving artefacts affected by AS. Our quantitative findings show how individual smell instances evolve over time, how long they typically survive within the system, how they overlap with instances of other smell types, and finally what the introduction order of smell types is when they overlap. Our qualitative findings, instead, provide insights on the effects of AS on the long-term maintainability and evolvability of the system, supported by several excerpts from our interviews. Practitioners also mention what parts of the AS analysis actually provide actionable insights that they can use to plan refactoring activities.</p><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.08702">link</a><br></div><div class="paper-info"><h2>Título 261: On the relation between architectural smells and source code changes</h2><h3>Autores: ['Darius Sas', 'Paris Avgeriou', 'Ilaria Pigazzini', 'Francesca Arcelli Fontana']</h3><h4>Ano: 2022</h4><p>Although architectural smells are one of the most studied type of architectural technical debt, their impact on maintenance effort has not been thoroughly investigated. Studying this impact would help to understand how much technical debt interest is being paid due to the existence of architecture smells and how this interest can be calculated. This work is a first attempt to address this issue by investigating the relation between architecture smells and source code changes. Specifically, we study whether the frequency and size of changes are correlated with the presence of a selected set of architectural smells. We detect architectural smells using the Arcan tool, which detects architectural smells by building a dependency graph of the system analyzed and then looking for the typical structures of the architectural smells. The findings, based on a case study of 31 open-source Java systems, show that 87% of the analyzed commits present more changes in artifacts with at least one smell, and the likelihood of changing increases with the number of smells. Moreover, there is also evidence to confirm that change frequency increases after the introduction of a smell and that the size of changes is also larger in smelly artifacts. These findings hold true especially in Medium–Large and Large artifacts.</p><br><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/smr.2398">link</a><br></div><div class="paper-info"><h2>Título 262: A triple bottom-line typology of technical debt: Supporting decision-making in cross-functional teams</h2><h3>Autores: ['Mark Greville', "Paidi O'Raghallaigh", 'Stephen McCarthy']</h3><h4>Ano: 2022</h4><p>Technical Debt (TD) is a widely discussed metaphor in IT practice focused on increased short-term benefit in exchange for long-term ‘debt’. While it is primarily individuals or groups inside IT departments who make the decisions to take on TD, we find that the effects of TD stretch across the entire organisation. Decisions to take on TD should therefore concern a wider group. However, business leaders have traditionally lacked awareness of the effects of what they perceive to be ‘technology decisions’. To facilitate TD as group-based decision-making, we review existing literature to develop a typology of the wider impacts of TD. The goal is to help technologists, non-technologists, and academics have a broader and shared understanding of TD and to facilitate more participatory and transparent technology-related decision making. We extend the typology to include a wider ‘outside in’ perspective and conclude by suggesting areas for further research.</p><br><a href="https://cora.ucc.ie/handle/10468/12453">link</a><br></div></body></html>
