  abstract  = {Software erosion can be controlled by periodically checking for consistency between the de facto architecture and its theoretical counterpart. Studies show that this process is often not automated and that developers still rely heavily on manual reviews, despite the availability of a large number of tools. This is partially due to the high cost involved in setting up and maintaining tool-specific and incompatible test specifications that replicate otherwise documented invariants. To reduce this cost, our approach consists in unifying the functionality provided by existing tools under the umbrella of a common business-readable DSL. By using a declarative language, we are able to write tool-agnostic rules that are simple enough to be understood by untrained stakeholders and, at the same time, can be interpreted as a rigorous specification for checking architecture conformance.},

The paper formalizes 32 refactoring recommendations to repair violations raised by static architecture conformance checking approaches; it describes a tool—called ArchFix—that triggers the proposed recommendations; and it evaluates the application of this tool in two industrial‐strength systems. For the first system—a 21 KLOC open‐source strategic management system—our approach has indicated correct refactoring recommendations for 31 out of 41 violations detected as the result of an architecture conformance process. For the second system—a 728 KLOC customer care system used by a major telecommunication company—our approach has triggered correct recommendations for 624 out of 787 violations, as asserted by the system's architect. Moreover, the architects have scored 82% of these recommendations as having moderate or major complexity.},

  abstract   = {Given the central role that software development plays in the delivery and application of information technology, managers are increasingly focusing on process improvement in the software development area. This demand has spurred the provision of a number of new and/or improved approaches to software development, with perhaps the most prominent being object-orientation (OO). In addition, the focus on process improvement has increased the demand for software measures, or metrics with which to manage the process. The need for such metrics is particularly acute when an organization is adopting a new technology for which established practices have yet to be developed. This research addresses these needs through the development and implementation of a new suite of metrics for OO design. Metrics developed in previous research, while contributing to the field's understanding of software development processes, have generally been subject to serious criticisms, including the lack of a theoretical base. Following Wand and Weber (1989), the theoretical base chosen for the metrics was the ontology of Bunge (1977). Six design metrics are developed, and then analytically evaluated against Weyuker's (1988) proposed set of measurement principles. An automated data collection tool was then developed and implemented to collect an empirical sample of these metrics at two field sites in order to demonstrate their feasibility and suggest ways in which managers may use these metrics for process improvement.},

  abstract  = {Global Software Development (GSD) is increasingly becoming the normal practice in the software industry, readily evidenced by U.S. estimates that the value of the offshore software development market has increased 25-fold over the past 10 years, to the extent that one-quarter of U.S. spending on application development, integration and management services is expected to go off-shore according to recent predictions. There are many potential benefits that can arise from GSD. The most frequently cited one is that of reduced development costs due to the salary savings possible. Also, GSD can lead to reduced development duration due to greater time zone effectiveness as companies practice the so-called 'follow-the-sun' software development model. GSD also affords new opportunities for cross-site modularization of development work, potential access to a larger and better-skilled developer pool, and the possibility of greater innovation, learning and transfer of best practices. Finally, GSD can facilitate closer proximity to markets and customers.
However, GSD also introduces a number of challenges in relation to communication, coordination and control of the development process. These arise due to the distances involved in three dimensions -- geographical, temporal, and socio-cultural (See Figure 1). As a consequence, much research and practice has focused on trying to find ways to overcome the GSD challenges identified in Figure 1. In the literature to date, the potential benefits of GSD are usually just mentioned very briefly, if they are mentioned at all, and the realization of these benefits seems to be more or less taken for granted. The primary focus instead is on how the problems inherent in GSD might be addressed. Here, we reverse this trend and focus instead on the benefits and the extent to which they are actually being realized in practice in three global companies practicing GSD.},

Our analysis used data from 362 projects of four different firms. These projects spanned a wide range of programming languages, application domain, process choices, and development sites spread over 15 countries and 5 continents. Our analysis revealed fundamental tradeoffs in choosing configurational choices that are optimized for productivity, quality, and/or profits. In particular, achieving higher levels of productivity and quality require diametrically opposed configurational choices. In addition, creating imbalances in the expertise and personnel distribution of project teams significantly helps increase profit margins. However, a profit-oriented imbalance could also significantly affect productivity and/or quality outcomes. Analyzing these complex tradeoffs, we provide actionable managerial insights that can help software firms and their clients choose configurations that achieve desired project outcomes in globally distributed software development.},

  abstract  = {We often hear that global software engineering teams are affected by time differences. While there is considerable research on the difficulties of distance, culture and other dimensions, there has been little research that isolated the impact of just time differences. The research question that guides us is whether there are gradual differences across time zones that impact team performance. In this study we conducted a laboratory experiment with 42 dyadic teams. The teams were randomly assigned into 4 time zone overlap conditions: full overlap, 2/3 overlap, 1/3 overlap and no overlap. Using a fictional map task, we found that participants' perceptions of process are unrelated to actual objective performance measures of speed and accuracy. Consistent with our expectations, we found that a small time separation has no effect on accuracy, but that more time separation has a significant effect on accuracy. Also consistent with our expectations, we found that a small amount of time separation has a significant effect on production speed. However, contrary to our expectations, we found that further increases in partial overlap have less significant effects on speed, and when there is no overlap speed actually increases, albeit not significantly - a "U-shaped" effect.},

Previous qualitative research suggests that distributed development may increase development cycle time for individual work items (modification requests). We use both data from the source code change management system and survey data to model the extent of delay in a distributed software development organization and explore several possible mechanisms for this delay. One key finding is that distributed work items appear to take about two and one-half times as long to complete as similar items where all the work is colocated. The data strongly suggest a mechanism for the delay, i.e., that distributed work items involve more people than comparable same-site work items, and the number of people involved is strongly related to the calendar time to complete a work item. We replicate the analysis of change data in a different organization with a different product and different sites and confirm our main findings. We also report survey results showing differences between same-site and distributed social networks, testing several hypotheses about characteristics of distributed social networks that may be related to delay. We discuss implications of our findings for practices and collaboration technology that have the potential for dramatically speeding distributed software development.},

This must happen in a systematic way so that technical debt does not swell up and damage the project. Accomplishing this is one of the major challenges in distributed agile projects. The scope of technical debt in software projects is spread across all areas including architecture, design, code, and test scripts.},

The ability of these methods to function with technical debt indicates that they contain components with inherent technical debt management capabilities. This study conducts a survey on industry practitioners to discover what is their level of technical debt knowledge, how does technical debt manifest in their projects and which of the applied components of agile software development -- both processes and practices -- are sensitive to technical debt. This paper contributes to the technical debt discussion by showing differences in assumed and indicated technical debt knowledge. Furthermore, components closest to implementation and its maintenance are perceived to have the most positive effects on technical debt management. Finally, the most encountered instances of technical debt are caused by architectural inadequacies, they are internal legacy, and increase in size as a result of continued implementation.},

With the concurrent development process model, multiple functions to a single software system are concurrently developed from the beginning of the development process, i.e. requirement specification, to system testing. In the distributed development process model, the development organization is decentralized into multiple development sites which are geographically distributed. The two dimensional changes require a fundamental re-think of our software process and brought about a significant impact on every aspect of software development activities ranging from individual developers to the entire project. We discuss the model, the issues in implementing the model, and our total system of managing the process, project and products.},

Much research has been performed to propose mechanisms to identify debt and decide the most appropriate moment to pay it off. It is important to investigate the current state of the art in order to provide both researchers and practitioners with information that enables further research activities as well as technical debt management in practice.
Objective: This paper has the following goals: to characterize the types of technical debt, identify indica- tors that can be used to find technical debt, identify management strategies, understand the maturity level of each proposal, and identify what visualization techniques have been proposed to support technical debt identification and management activities.
Method: A systematic mapping study was performed based on a set of three research questions. In total, 100 studies, dated from 2010 to 2014, were evaluated.
Results: We proposed an initial taxonomy of technical debt types, created a list of indicators that have been proposed to identify technical debt, identified the existing management strategies, and analyzed the current state of art on technical debt, identifying topics where new research efforts can be invested.
Conclusion: The results of this mapping study can help to identify points that still require further investigation in technical debt research.},

  pages     = {21--40},
  volume    = {99},
  abstract  = {Context: Software projects frequently incur schedule and budget overruns. Planning and estimation are particularly challenging in large and globally distributed agile projects. While software engineering researchers have been investigating effort estimation for many years to help practitioners to improve their estimation processes, there is little empirical research about effort estimation in large-scale distributed projects involving agile teams.

Objective: The objective of this paper is three-fold: i) To identify how effort estimation is carried out in large-scale distributed agile projects; ii) to analyze the accuracy of the effort estimation processes in large-scale distributed agile projects; and iii) to identify and investigate the factors that impact the accuracy of effort estimates in large-scale distributed agile projects.

Method: We performed an exploratory longitudinal case study. The data collection was operationalized through archival research and semi-structured interviews.

Results: The main findings of the studied case are: 1) A two-stage estimation process, with re-estimation at the analysis stage, improves the accuracy of the effort estimates; 2) underestimation is the dominant trend; 3) less mature teams incur larger effort overruns; 4) requirements with larger size/scope incur larger effort overruns; 5) requirements developed in multi-site settings incur larger effort overruns as compared to requirements developed in a co-located setting; 6) requirements priorities impact the accuracy of the effort estimates.

Conclusion: A two-stage effort estimation process can improve effort estimation accuracy and seems to address some of the challenges in large-scale agile software development. To improve effort estimates one needs to consider team maturity, distribution as well as requirements size and priorities.},

Results from this research demonstrate that many factors are reality for those involved in global software development. In this paper we present five of these factors and discuss the impact these had on the virtual teams.

We call these flawed structures the architecture roots, a type of technical debt that incurs high maintenance penalties. Removing the architecture roots of bugginess requires refactoring, but the benefits of refactoring have historically been difficult for architects to quantify or justify. In this paper, we present a case study of identifying and quantifying such architecture debts in a large-scale industrial software project. Our approach is to model and analyze software architecture as a set of design rule spaces (DRSpaces). Using data extracted from the project's development artifacts, we were able to identify the files implicated in architecture flaws and suggest refactorings based on removing these flaws. Then we built economic models of the before and (predicted) after states, which gave the organization confidence that doing the refactorings made business sense, in terms of a handsome return on investment.},

Many large organizations are struggling to successfully adopt agile methods, but there is still little scientific knowledge on requirements management in large-scale agile development organizations. We present an in-depth study of an Ericsson telecommunications node development organization which employs a large scale agile method to develop telecommunications system software. We describe how the requirements flow from strategy to release, and related benefits and problems. Data was collected by 43 interviews, which were analyzed qualitatively. The requirements management was done in three different processes, each of which had a different process model, purpose and planning horizon. The release project management process was plan-driven, feature development process was continuous and implementation management process was agile. The perceived benefits included reduced development lead time, increased flexibility, increased planning efficiency, increased developer motivation and improved communication effectiveness. The recognized problems included difficulties in balancing planning effort, overcommitment, insufficient understanding of the development team autonomy, defining the product owner role, balancing team specialization, organizing system-level work and growing technical debt. The study indicates that agile development methods can be successfully employed in organizations where the higher level planning processes are not agile. Combining agile methods with a flexible feature development process can bring many benefits, but large-scale software development seems to require specialist roles and significant coordination effort. © 2016, The Author(s).},

To survive, IT firms must develop high quality software products on time and at low cost. A key issue is whether high levels of quality can be achieved without adversely impacting cycle time and effort. Conventional beliefs hold that processes to improve software quality can be implemented only at the expense of longer cycle times and greater development effort. However, an alternate view is that quality improvement, faster cycle time, and effort reduction can be simultaneously attained by reducing defects and rework. In this study, we empirically investigate the relationship between process maturity, quality, cycle time, and effort for the development of 30 software products by a major IT firm. We find that higher levels of process maturity as assessed by the Software Engineering Institute's Capability Maturity Model™ are associated with higher product quality, but also with increases in development effort. However, our findings indicate that the reductions in cycle time and effort due to improved quality outweigh the increases from achieving higher levels of process maturity. Thus, the net effect of process maturity is reduced cycle time and development effort.},

In this study, one large software development organization is investigated to gather empirical evidence related to the concept of technical debt management (TDM). We used the exploratory case study method to collect and analyze empirical data in the case organization by interviewing a total of 25 persons in eight software development teams. We were able to identify teams where the current strategy for TDM was only to fix TD when necessary, when it started to cause too much trouble for development. We also identified teams where the management had a systematic strategy to identify, measure and monitor TD during the development process. It seems that TDM can be associated with a similar maturity concept as software development in general. Development teams may raise their maturity by increasing their awareness and applying more advanced processes, techniques and tools in TDM. TDM is an essential part of sustainable software development, and companies have to find right approaches to deal with TD to produce healthy software that can be developed and maintained in the future. © 2016 The Authors},

  abstract  = {Context
The concept of technical debt (TD) contextualizes problems faced during software evolution considering the tasks that are not carried out adequately during its development. Currently, it is common to associate any impediment related to the software product and its development process to the definition of TD. This can bring confusion and ambiguity in the use of the term. Besides, due to the increasing amount of work in the area, it is difficult to have a comprehensive view of the plethora of proposals on TD management.

Objective
This paper intends to investigate the current state of research on TD by identifying what research topics have been considered, organizing research directions and practical knowledge that has already been defined, identifying the known types of TD, and organizing what activities, strategies and tools have been proposed to support the management of TD.

Method
A tertiary study was performed based on a set of five research questions. In total, 13 secondary studies, dated from 2012 to March 2018, were evaluated.

Results
The results of this tertiary study are beneficial for both practitioners and researchers. We evolved a taxonomy of TD types, identified a list of situations in which debt items can be found in software projects, and organized a map representing the state of the art of activities, strategies and tools to support TD management. Besides, we also summarized some research directions and practical knowledge, and identified the research topics that have been more considered in secondary studies.

Conclusion
This tertiary study revisited the TD landscape. Its results can help to identify points that still require further investigation in TD research.},

  abstract  = {A Cloud-based Service-Oriented Architecture (CBSOA) is typically composed of web services, which are offered off the cloud marketplace. CB-SOA can improve its utility and add value to its composition by switching among its constituent services. We look at the option to defer the decision of substitution under uncertainty. We exploit Binomial Options to the formulation. We quantify the time-value of the architecture decisions of switching web services and technical debt they can imply on the structure. As CB-SOA are market-sensitive, dynamic and volatile, the decision of deferral tends to be sensitive to these dynamics. Henceforth, the structural complexity of a CB-SOAcan change over time and so the technical debt as its constituent web services are modified, replaced, upgraded, etc. The method builds on Design Structure Matrix (DSM) and introduces time and complexity aware propagation cost metrics to assess the value of deferral decisions relative to changes in the structure. Architects of CB-SOA can use our method to assess the time value of deferring the decisions to switch web services relative to complexity, technical debt and value creation. We demonstrate the applicability of the method using an illustrative example.},

  abstract  = {Technical Debt Management (TDM) has drawn the attention of software industries during the last years, including embedded systems. However, we currently lack an overview of how practitioners from this application domain perceive technical debt. To this end, we conducted a multiple case study in the embedded systems industry, to investigate: (a) the expected life-time of components that have TD, (b) the most frequently occurring types of TD in them, and (c) the significance of TD against run-time quality attributes. The case study was performed on seven embedded systems industries (telecommunications, printing, smart manufacturing, sensors, etc.) from five countries (Greece, Netherlands, Sweden, Austria, and Finland). The results of the case study suggest that: (a) maintainability is more seriously considered when the expected lifetime of components is larger than ten years, (b) the most frequent types of debt are test, architectural, and code debt, and (c) in embedded systems the run-time qualities are prioritized compared to design-time qualities that are usually associated with TD. The obtained results can be useful for both researchers and practitioners: the former can focus their research on the most industrially-relevant aspects of TD, whereas the latter can be informed about the most common types of TD and how to focus their TDM processes. © 2016 IEEE.},

Incurring technical debt may bring short-term benefits to a project, but such benefits are often achieved at the cost of extra work in future, analogous to paying interest on the debt. Currently technical debt is managed implicitly, if at all. However, on large systems, it is too easy to lose track of delayed tasks or to misunderstand their impact. Therefore, we have proposed a new approach to managing technical debt, which we believe to be helpful for software managers to make informed decisions. In this study we explored the costs of the new approach by tracking the technical debt management activities in an on-going software project. The results from the study provided insights into the impact of technical debt management on software projects. In particular, we found that there is a significant start-up cost when beginning to track and monitor technical debt, but the cost of ongoing management soon declines to very reasonable levels. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

Our partner in this research is a large Nordic IT company Tieto, currently in a need for new ways to improve their technical debt management. The results include a set of processes and templates that were successfully used to identify and document technical debt.

Much of the research on technical debt has focused on decisions made by project architects and individual developers who choose to trade off short-term gain for a longer-term cost. However, in the context of enterprise software development, such a model may be too narrow. We explore the premise that technical debt within the enterprise should be viewed as a tool similar to financial leverage, allowing the organization to incur debt to pursue options that it couldn't otherwise afford. We test this premise by interviewing a set of experienced architects to understand how decisions to acquire technical debt are made within an enterprise, and to what extent the acquisition of technical debt provides leverage. We find that in many cases, the decision to acquire technical debt is not made by technical architects, but rather by non-technical stakeholders who cause the project to acquire new technical debt or discover existing technical debt that wasn't previously visible. We conclude with some preliminary observations and recommendations for organizations to better manage technical debt in the presence of some enterprise-scale circumstances.},

The report contains our initial findings based on ethnographic observations and semi-structured interviews. The goal is to identify the best practices regarding managing technical debt so that the researchers and the practitioners can further evaluate these practices to extend their knowledge of the technical debt metaphor. We determined that the developers considered their own taxonomy of technical debt based on the type of work they were assigned and their personal understanding of the term. Despite management's high-level categories, the developers mostly considered design debt, testing debt and defect debt. In addition to developers having their own taxonomy, assigning dedicated teams for technical debt reduction and allowing other teams about 20% of time per sprint for debt reduction are good initiatives towards lowering technical debt. While technical debt has become a well-regarded concept in the Agile community, further empirical evaluation is needed to assess how to properly apply the concept for various development organizations.},

Software TD is a type of debt that brings a short-term benefit, but which may have to be paid with interest later on in the software development life cycle. Its presence brings risks to the project and can reduce its quality. It is worthwhile to have automatic mechanisms to monitor it, as TD monitoring requires the analysis of large amounts of complex data. Therefore, the combination of software metrics and code comment analysis, in the identification, and information visualization techniques, in monitoring, present themselves as a promising strategy to manage TD. This work presents VisminerTD, a tool that allows the automatic identification and interactive monitoring of the evolution of TD items by combining software metrics, code comment analysis, and information visualization. To evaluate its applicability, a feasibility study was carried out considering JUnit 4 and Apache Ant software projects. The results indicated that VisminerTD can support software development teams in monitoring TD items. In addition, a second case study was performed to assess the feasibility of the proposed tool regarding its usefulness, ease of use, and self-predicted future use. The results provided positive evidence on the use of the proposed tool, indicating (i) that it can be useful in supporting TD Identification and TD monitoring activities and (ii) that it can bring gains in terms of comprehensiveness and efficacy when evaluating the desirable time to identify and monitor different types of debt. Given the current scenario characterized by limited options of tools that combine different information to support automatic identification and monitoring of the evolution of TD items in software projects, VisminerTD can approximate the state-of-the-art and the state-of-the-practice in the TD area, contributing to a wider dissemination of the concept.},

However, this can be hindered by evolution limitations and high maintenance efforts due to internal software quality issues by what is described as Technical Debt. Although significant theoretical work has been undertaken to describe the negative effects of Technical Debt, these studies tend to have a weak empirical basis and often lack quantitative data. The aim of this study is to estimate wasted time, caused by the Technical Debt interest during the software life-cycle. This study also investigates how practitioners perceive and estimate the impact of the negative consequences due to Technical Debt during the software development process. This paper reports the results of both an online web-survey provided quantitative data from 258 participants and follow-up interviews with 32 industrial software practitioners. The importance and originality of this study contributes and provides novel insights into the research on Technical Debt by quantifying the perceived interest and the negative effects it has on the software development life-cycle. The findings show that on average, 36 percent of all development time is estimated to be wasted due to Technical Debt; Complex Architectural Design and Requirement Technical Debt generates most negative effect; and that most time is wasted on understanding and/or measuring the Technical Debt. Moreover, the analysis of the professional roles and the age of the software system in the survey revealed that different roles are affected differently and that the consequences of Technical Debt are also influenced by the age of the software system.},

However, to the best of our knowledge there are no large scale studies that focus on the types of issues that are fixed and the amount of TD that is paid back during software evolution. In this paper we present the results of a case study, in which we analyzed the evolution of fifty-seven Java open-source software projects by the Apache Software Foundation at the temporal granularity level of weekly snapshots. In particular, we focus on the amount of technical debt that is paid back and the types of issues that are fixed. The findings reveal that a small subset of all issue types is responsible for the largest percentage of TD repayment and thus, targeting particular violations the development team can achieve higher benefits.},

So, the architectural decisions were centralized to a team of architects. The team extensively used code reviews to not only check the code's state but also reveal defects that could turn into maintainability problems. The study results also suggest that the effort architects spend designing architecture, guarding its integrity and evolvability, and mentoring development teams is directly related to team maturity. In addition, significant investment is needed whenever new teams and locations are onboarded.},

be used by the project, on the system ability to recover from

the project recovers from project disasters related to process

synchronicity theory to account for how information exchange

how different interventions impact communication effectiveness.

  abstract     = {Background: Developers and development teams in large-scale software development are often required to learn continuously. Organizations also face the need to train and support new developers and teams on-boarded in ongoing projects. Although learning is associated with performance improvements, experience shows that training and learning does not always result in a better performance or significant improvements might take too long.

Aims: In this paper, we report our experiences from establishing an approach to measure learning results and associated performance impact for developers and teams in Ericsson.

Method: Experiences reported herein are a part of an exploratory case study of an on-going large-scale distributed project in Ericsson. The data collected for our measurements included archival data and expert knowledge acquired through both unstructured and semi-structured interviews. While performing the measurements, we faced a number of challenges, documented in the form of lessons learned.

Results: We aggregated our experience in eight lessons learned related to collection, preparation and analysis of data for further measurement of learning potential and performance in large-scale distributed software development.

Conclusions: Measuring learning and performance is a challenging task. Major problems were related to data inconsistencies caused by, among other factors, distributed nature of the project. We believe that the documented experiences shared herein can help other researchers and practitioners to perform similar measurements and overcome the challenges of large-scale distributed software projects, as well as proactively address these challenges when establishing project measurement programs.},

Background. Content analysis is a method that may be used with either qualitative or quantitative data and in an inductive or deductive way. Qualitative content analysis is commonly used in nursing studies but little has been published on the analysis process and many research books generally only provide a short description of this method.

Discussion. When using content analysis, the aim was to build a model to describe the phenomenon in a conceptual form. Both inductive and deductive analysis processes are represented as three main phases: preparation, organizing and reporting. The preparation phase is similar in both approaches. The concepts are derived from the data in inductive content analysis. Deductive content analysis is used when the structure of analysis is operationalized on the basis of previous knowledge.

Conclusion. Inductive content analysis is used in cases where there are no previous studies dealing with the phenomenon or when it is fragmented. A deductive approach is useful if the general aim was to test a previous theory in a different situation or to compare categories at different time periods.},

Much like technical debt, social debt impacts heavily on software development success. We argue that, to ensure quality software engineering, practitioners should be provided with mechanisms to detect and manage the social debt connected to their development communities.

  abstract  = {Technical debt is a metaphor for immature, incomplete, or inadequate artifacts in the software development lifecycle that cause higher costs and lower quality in the long run. These artifacts remaining in a system affect subsequent development and maintenance activities, and so can be seen as a type of debt that the system developers owe the system. Incurring technical debt may speed up software development in the short run, but such benefit is achieved at the cost of extra work in the future, as if paying interest on the debt. In this sense, the technical debt metaphor characterizes the relationship between the short-term benefits of delay- ing certain software maintenance tasks or doing them quickly and less carefully, and the long-term cost of those delays. However, managing technical debt is more complicated than managing financial debt because of the uncertainty involved. In this chapter, the authors review the main issues associated with technical debt, and propose a technical debt management framework and a research plan for validation. The objective of our research agenda is to develop and validate a comprehensive technical debt theory that formalizes the relationship between the cost and benefit sides of the concept. Further, we propose to use the theory to propose mechanisms (processes and tools) for measuring and managing technical debt in software product maintenance. The theory and management mechanisms are intended ultimately to contribute to the improved quality of software and facilitate decision making in software maintenance.},

  abstract  = {In a company producing off‐the‐shelf software for mass markets, the future development steps of the products cannot be negotiated with one or few customers. The decisions concerning the priorities of the requirements must be made within the company, the developer bearing all the financial risks included. This means that finding the right priorities for the requirements is important. However, requirements prioritization is recognized as a difficult activity in software product development. The literature offers methods for requirements prioritization, but many authors report that practices in companies are mostly informal. In this study, we evaluated two requirements prioritization methods in industrial product development projects. In the first case, the users of the system evaluated the pair‐wise comparison technique for prioritizing user needs. In the second case, practitioners evaluated Wiegers' method for change requests. In addition, we interviewed 11 practitioners from 6 companies about their current requirements prioritization practices and the models that they use as a basis of their prioritization decisions. Our findings indicate that prioritization methods may have limited ability to support decision‐making in a complex area like requirements prioritization in market‐driven product development. In addition, there are practical difficulties in the usage of methods, and therefore, prioritization results should be taken more as being indicative than as an ultimate truth.

This paper reports the results of surveying 17 software practitioners, together with follow-up interviews with them.

Often, technical debt issues are managed and prioritized in a shadow backlog, separate from the official sprint backlog. This study was also able to identify several different challenges related to prioritizing technical debt, such as the lack of quantitative information about the technical debt items and that the refactoring of technical debt issues competes with the implementation of customer requirements.},

The analysis of results focuses on frequencies of publications for categories within the scheme. Thereby, the coverage of the research field can be determined. Different facets of the scheme can also be combined to answer more specific research questions.

OBJECTIVE: We describe how to conduct a systematic mapping study in software engineering and provide guidelines. We also compare systematic maps and systematic reviews to clarify how to chose between them. This comparison leads to a set of guidelines for systematic maps.

METHOD: We have defined a systematic mapping process and applied it to complete a systematic mapping study. Furthermore, we compare systematic maps with systematic reviews by systematically analyzing existing systematic reviews.

RESULTS: We describe a process for software engineering systematic mapping studies and compare it to systematic reviews. Based on this, guidelines for conducting systematic maps are defined.

CONCLUSIONS: Systematic maps and reviews are different in terms of goals, breadth, validity issues and implications. Thus, they should be used complementarily and require different methods (e.g., for analysis).},

Elements are either processing, data, or connecting elements. Form is defined in terms of the properties of, and the relationships among, the elements --- that is, the constraints on the elements. The rationale provides the underlying basis for the architecture in terms of the system constraints, which most often derive from the system requirements. We discuss the components of the model in the context of both architectures and architectural styles and present an extended example to illustrate some important architecture and style considerations. We conclude by presenting some of the benefits of our approach to software architecture, summarizing our contributions, and relating our approach to other current work.},

Technical debt (TD) is a metaphor reflecting technical compromises that can yield short-term benefit but may hurt the long-term health of a software system.

Objective
This work aims at collecting studies on TD and TD management (TDM), and making a classification and thematic analysis on these studies, to obtain a comprehensive understanding on the TD concept and an overview on the current state of research on TDM.

Method
A systematic mapping study was performed to identify and analyze research on TD and its management, covering publications between 1992 and 2013.

Results
Ninety-four studies were finally selected. TD was classified into 10 types, 8 TDM activities were identified, and 29 tools for TDM were collected.

Conclusions
The term “debt” has been used in different ways by different people, which leads to ambiguous interpretation of the term. Code-related TD and its management have gained the most attention. There is a need for more empirical studies with high-quality evidence on the whole TDM process and on the application of specific TDM approaches in industrial settings. Moreover, dedicated TDM tools are needed for managing various types of TD in the whole TDM process.},

In this paper, we describe taking an architecture-focused and measurement-based approach to develop a metric that assists in strategically managing technical debt. Such an approach can be used to optimize the cost of development over time while continuing to deliver value to the customer.

During the years several approaches for ATD identification have been conceived, each of them addressing ATD from diferent perspectives and with heterogeneous characteristics. In this paper we apply the systematic mapping study methodology for identifying, classifying, and evaluating the state of the art on ATD identification from the following three perspectives: publication trends, characteristics, and potential for industrial adoption. Specically, starting from a set of 509 potentially relevant studies, we systematically selected 47 primary studies and analyzed them according to a rigorously-de ned classification framework. The analysis of the obtained results supports both researchers and practitioners by providing (i) an assessment of current research trends and gaps in ATD identification, (ii) a solid foundation for understanding existing (and future) research on ATD identification, and (iii) a rigorous evaluation of its potential for industrial adoption.},

  abstract  = {Context: Software Engineering (SE) is an evolving discipline with new subareas being continuously developed and added. To structure and better understand the SE body of knowledge, taxonomies have been proposed in all SE knowledge areas.

Objective: The objective of this paper is to characterize the state-of-the-art research on SE taxonomies.

Method: A systematic mapping study was conducted, based on 270 primary studies.

Results: An increasing number of SE taxonomies have been published since 2000 in a broad range of venues, including the top SE journals and conferences. The majority of taxonomies can be grouped into the following SWEBOK knowledge areas: construction (19.55%), design (19.55%), requirements (15.50%) and maintenance (11.81%). Illustration (45.76%) is the most frequently used approach for taxonomy validation. Hierarchy (53.14%) and faceted analysis (39.48%) are the most frequently used classification structures. Most taxonomies rely on qualitative procedures to classify subject matter instances, but in most cases (86.53%) these procedures are not described in sufficient detail. The majority of the taxonomies (97%) target unique subject matters and many taxonomy-papers are cited frequently. Most SE taxonomies are designed in an ad-hoc way. To address this issue, we have revised an existing method for developing taxonomies in a more systematic way.

Conclusion: There is a strong interest in taxonomies in SE, but few taxonomies are extended or revised. Taxonomy design decisions regarding the used classification structures, procedures and descriptive bases are usually not well described and motivated.},

  abstract  = {In recent years, members of the steering committee of the IEEE Requirements Engineering (RE) Conference have discussed paper classification and evaluation criteria for RE papers. The immediate trigger for this discussion was our concern about differences in opinion that sometimes arise in program committees about the criteria to be used in evaluating papers. If program committee members do not all use the same criteria, or if they use criteria different from those used by authors, then papers might be rejected or accepted for the wrong reasons. Surely not all papers should be evaluated according to the same criteria. Some papers describe new techniques but do not report on empirical research; others describe new conceptual frameworks for investigating certain RE problems; others report on industrial experience with existing RE techniques. Other kinds of papers can also be easily recognized. All of these types of papers should be evaluated according to different criteria. But we are far from a consensus about what classes of paper we should distinguish, and what the criteria are for each of these classes.

We see a variety of evaluation criteria in journals too. At one extreme is the set of nine genres used by IEEE Software [15], all of which have different evaluation criteria. At the other extreme is the single paper class recognized by the Requirements Engineering Journal, which has the following evaluation criteria: originality, utility, technical contribution, and relation to previous work. Apparently, the only paper class recognized by the Requirements Engineering Journal is a paper describing an original and useful solution technique. This corresponds to the “how to” genre of IEEE Software. This leaves authors and reviewers for the Requirements Engineering Journal in the dark about how other classes of papers should be judged, such as experience reports, empirical studies, or tutorials, none of which describe an original technique. This might lead to the use, by reviewers, of evaluation criteria unknown to authors, or even to the use of mutually inconsistent evaluation criteria by different reviewers of the same submission.

The calls for papers of successive RE conferences, in which some of us acted as program chair, show an evolution of paper classification and evaluation schemes. Each scheme was based on the experience of the previous chair, and we tried to pass on our experience to the next chair. We also discussed our ideas with other members of the Steering Committee of the RE conferences, and with RE researchers outside the Steering Committee. This short note presents the outcome of those discussions in the form of a proposal for paper classification and a set of evaluation criteria for different paper classes. We hope to include more people in the discussion and thereby further improve the classification and evaluation scheme.

In Section 2, we sketch the rationale for our classification. Section 3 presents the classification, and Section 4 concludes with a discussion of background ideas and related work.},

However, decisions on if and when to refactor architecture are extremely important and difficult to take, since changing software at the architectural level is quite expensive. Therefore it is important, for software organizations, to have methods and tools that aid architects and managers to understand if Architecture Technical Debt will generate a costly and growing interest to be paid or not. Current knowledge, especially empirically developed and evaluated, is quite scarce. In this paper we developed and evaluated a method, AnaConDebt, by analyzing, together with several practitioners, 12 existing cases of Architecture Debt in 6 companies. The method has been refined several times in order to be useful and effective in practice. We also report the evaluation of the method with a final case, for which we present anonymized results and subsequent refactoring decisions. The method consists of several components that need to be analyzed, combining the theoretical Technical Debt framework and the practical experience of the practitioners, in order to identify the key factors involved in the growth of interest. The output of the method shows summarized indicators that visualizes the factors in a useful way for the stakeholders. This analysis aids the practitioners in deciding on if and when to refactor Architectural Technical Debt items. The method has been evaluated and has been proven useful to support the architects into systematically analyze and decide upon a case.},

The idea is that developers sometimes accept compromises in a system in one dimension (e.g., modularity) to meet an urgent demand in some other dimension (e.g., a deadline), and that such compromises incur a “debt”: on which “interest” has to be paid and which the “principal” should be repaid at some point for the long-term health of the project. We argue that the software engineering research community has an opportunity to study and improve this concept. We can offer software engineers a foundation for managing such trade-offs based on models of their economic impacts.

Whilst technical debt is considered to be detrimental to the long term success of software development, it appears to be poorly understood in academic literature. The absence of a clear definition and model for technical debt exacerbates the challenge of its identification and adequate management, thus preventing the realisation of technical debt's utility as a conceptual and technical communication device.

Objective
To make a critical examination of technical debt and consolidate understanding of the nature of technical debt and its implications for software development.

Method
An exploratory case study technique that involves multivocal literature review, supplemented by interviews with software practitioners and academics to establish the boundaries of the technical debt phenomenon.

Result
A key outcome of this research is the creation of a theoretical framework that provides a holistic view of technical debt comprising a set of technical debts dimensions, attributes, precedents and outcomes, as well as the phenomenon itself and a taxonomy that describes and encompasses different forms of the technical debt phenomenon.

Conclusion
The proposed framework provides a useful approach to understanding the overall phenomenon of technical debt for practical purposes. Future research should incorporate empirical studies to validate heuristics and techniques that will assist practitioners in their management of technical debt.},

Such incomplete or temporary workarounds are commonly referred to as 'technical debt'. Our experience indicates that self-admitted technical debt is common in software projects and may negatively impact software maintenance, however, to date very little is known about them. Therefore, in this paper, we use source-code comments in four large open source software projects-Eclipse, Chromium OS, Apache HTTP Server, and ArgoUML to identify self-admitted technical debt. Using the identified technical debt, we study 1) the amount of self-admitted technical debt found in these projects, 2) why this self-admitted technical debt was introduced into the software projects and 3) how likely is the self-admitted technical debt to be removed after their introduction. We find that the amount of self-admitted technical debt exists in 2.4%-31% of the files. Furthermore, we find that developers with higher experience tend to introduce most of the self-admitted technical debt and that time pressures and complexity of the code do not correlate with the amount of self-admitted technical debt. Lastly, although self-admitted technical debt is meant to be addressed or removed in the future, only between 26.3%-63.5% of self-admitted technical debt gets removed from projects after introduction.},

Architecture of a software system represents the key design decisions and therefore its quality plays an important role to keep the software maintainable. Code smells are indicators of quality issues in a software system and are classified based on their granularity, scope, and impact. Despite a plethora of existing work on smells, a detailed exploration of architecture smells, their characteristics, and their relationships with smells in other granularities is missing.

Objective:
The paper aims to study architecture smells characteristics, investigate correlation, collocation, and causation relationships between architecture and design smells.

Method:
We implement smell detection support for seven architecture smells. We mine 3 073 open-source repositories containing more than 118 million lines of C# code and empirically investigate the relationships between seven architecture and 19 design smells.

Results:
We find that smell density does not depend on repository size. Cumulatively, architecture smells are highly correlated with design smells. Our collocation analysis finds that the majority of design and architecture smell pairs do not exhibit collocation. Finally, our causality analysis reveals that design smells cause architecture smells.},

This puts high requirements on having an architecture and design that can handle these demands. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to manage Architecture Technical Debt, in order to make sure that the advantages of sub-optimal solutions do not lead to the payment of a large interest. We conducted a case study at Volvo Car Group and we discovered that architectural violations in the detailed design had an impact on the efficiency of the communication between components, which is an essential quality in cars and other embedded systems. Such interest is not studied in literature, which usually focuses on the maintainability aspects of Technical Debt. To explore how this Architectural Technical Debt and its interest could be communicated to stakeholders, we developed a visual tool. We found that not only was the Architectural Debt highly interesting for the architects and other stakeholders at VCG, but the proposed visualization was useful in increasing the awareness of the impact that Architectural Technical Debt had on efficiency.},

  abstract  = {To predict files with defects, a suitable prediction model must be built for a software project from either itself (within-project) or other projects (cross-project). A universal defect prediction model that is built from the entire set of diverse projects would relieve the need for building models for an individual project. A universal model could also be interpreted as a basic relationship between software metrics and defects. However, the variations in the distribution of predictors pose a formidable obstacle to build a universal model. Such variations exist among projects with different context factors (e.g., size and programming language). To overcome this challenge, we propose context-aware rank transformations for predictors. We cluster projects based on the similarity of the distribution of 26 predictors, and derive the rank transformations using quantiles of predictors for a cluster. We then fit the universal model on the transformed data of 1,398 open source projects hosted on SourceForge and GoogleCode. Adding context factors to the universal model improves the predictive power. The universal model obtains prediction performance comparable to the within-project models and yields similar results when applied on five external projects (one Apache and four Eclipse projects). These results suggest that a universal defect prediction model may be an achievable goal.},

With this approach, the history of a file can be reconstructed across repository boundaries and thus provides accurate information for any source code analysis. We evaluate the approach in terms of correctness, completeness, performance, and relevance with a case study among seven open source systems and a developer survey.},

Among those are the reliability assumption implicit in the application of any code metric, and the assumption that the magnitude of change, i.e., increase or decrease of its size, in a software artifact is correlated with changes to its version number. Putting a suite of 36 metrics to the trial, we confirm most of the assumptions on a large repository of software artifacts. Surprisingly, we show that a substantial portion of the reliability of some metrics can be observed even in random changes to architecture. Another surprising result is that Boolean-valued metrics tend to flip their values more often in minor software version increments than in major increments.},

This field is concerned with the use of data mining to provide useful insights into how to improve software engineering processes and software itself, supporting decision-making. For that, data produced by software engineering processes and products during and after software development are used. Despite promising results, there is frequently a lack of discussion on the role of software engineering practitioners amidst the data mining approaches. This makes adoption of data mining by software engineering practitioners difficult. Moreover, the fact that experts’ knowledge is frequently ignored by data mining approaches, together with the lack of transparency of such approaches, can hinder the acceptability of data mining by software engineering practitioners. To overcome these problems, this position paper provides a discussion of the role of software engineering experts when adopting data mining approaches. It also argues that this role can be extended to increase experts’ involvement in the process of building data mining models. We believe that such extended involvement is not only likely to increase software engineers’ acceptability of the resulting models, but also improve the models themselves. We also provide some recommendations aimed at increasing the success of experts involvement and model acceptability.},

While the specification of such rules is time-consuming, they are similar across software projects adhering to similar architecture decompositions. Unfortu-nately, existing anti-degradation techniques are limited as they focus only on detecting either drift or erosion symptoms. They also do not support the reuse of recurring anti-degradation rules. In this context, the contribution of this paper is twofold. First, it presents TamDera, a domain-specific language for: (i) specifying rule-based strategies to detect both erosion and drift symptoms, and (ii) promoting the hierarchical and compositional reuse of design rules across multiple projects. The language was designed with usual concepts from programming languages in mind such as, inheritance and modularization. Second, we evaluated to what extent developers would benefit from the definition and reuse of hybrid rules. Our study involved 21 versions pertaining to 5 software projects, and more than 600 rules. On average 45% of classes that had drift symptoms in first versions presented inter-related erosion problems in latter versions or vice-versa. Also, up to 72% of all the TamDera rules in a project are from a pre-defined library of reusable rules. They were responsible for detecting on average of 73% of the inter-related degradation symptoms across the projects.},

An important component of technical debt relates to decisions about system architecture. As systems grow and evolve, their architectures can degrade, increasing maintenance costs and reducing developer productivity. This raises the question if and when it might be appropriate to redesign (“refactor”) a system, to reduce what has been called “architectural debt”. Unfortunately, we lack robust data by which to evaluate the relationship between architectural design choices and system maintenance costs, and hence to predict the value that might be released through such refactoring efforts.

We address this gap by analyzing the relationship between system architecture and maintenance costs for two software systems of similar size, but with very different structures; one has a “Hierarchical” design, the other has a “Core-Periphery” design. We measure the level of system coupling for the 20,000+ components in each system, and use these measures to predict maintenance efforts, or “defect-related activity.” We show that in both systems, the tightly-coupled Core or Central components cost significantly more to maintain then loosely-coupled Peripheral components. In essence, a small number of components generate a large proportion of system costs. However, we find major differences in the potential benefits available from refactoring these systems, related to their differing designs. Our results generate insight into how architectural debt can be assessed by understanding patterns of coupling among components in a system.},

  abstract = {Two tasks that software engineers constantly perform are writing code that is easy to evolve and maintain, and detecting poorly written pieces of code. For the former, software engineers commonly rely on well-known software architecture styles, such as Model-View-Controller (MVC). To the latter, they rely on code metrics and code smell detection approaches. However, up to now, these code metrics and code smell approaches do not take into account underlying architectureall classes are assessed as if they were the same. In practice, software developers know that classes differ in terms of responsibilities and implementation, and thus, we expect these classes to present different levels of coupling, cohesion, and complexity. As an example, in an MVC system, Controllers are responsible for the flow between the Model and the View, and Models are responsible for representing the systems business concepts. Thus, in this thesis, we evaluate the impact of architectural roles within a system architecture on code metrics and code smells. We performed an empirical analysis in 120 open source systems, and interviewed and surveyed more than 50 software developers. Our findings show that each architectural role has a different code metric values distribution, which is a likely consequence of their specific responsibilities. Thus, we propose SATT, an approach that provides specific thresholds for architectural roles that are significantly different from others in terms of code smells. We also show that classes that play a specific architectural role contain specific code smells, which developers perceive as problems, and can impact class' change- and defect-proneness. Based on our findings, we suggest that developers understand the responsibilities of each architectural role in their system architecture, so that code metrics and code smells techniques can provide more accurate feedback.},

To perform our validation accurately, we collected data on the development of eight medium-sized information management systems based on identical requirements. All eight projects were developed using a sequential life cycle model, a well-known OO analysis/design method and the C++ programming language. Based on empirical and quantitative analysis, the advantages and drawbacks of these OO metrics are discussed. Several of Chidamber and Kemerer's OO metrics appear to be useful to predict class fault-proneness during the early phases of the life-cycle. Also, on our data set, they are better predictors than "traditional" code metrics, which can only be collected at a later phase of the software development processes.},

  abstract  = {Context
Technical debt is a software engineering metaphor, referring to the eventual financial consequences of trade-offs between shrinking product time to market and poorly specifying, or implementing a software product, throughout all development phases. Based on its inter-disciplinary nature, i.e. software engineering and economics, research on managing technical debt should be balanced between software engineering and economic theories.

Objective
The aim of this study is to analyze research efforts on technical debt, by focusing on their financial aspect. Specifically, the analysis is carried out with respect to: (a) how financial aspects are defined in the context of technical debt and (b) how they relate to the underlying software engineering concepts.

Method
In order to achieve the abovementioned goals, we employed a standard method for SLRs and applied it on studies retrieved from seven general-scope digital libraries. In total we selected 69 studies relevant to the financial aspect of technical debt.

Results
The most common financial terms that are used in technical debt research are principal and interest, whereas the financial approaches that have been more frequently applied for managing technical debt are real options, portfolio management, cost/benefit analysis and value-based analysis. However, the application of such approaches lacks consistency, i.e., the same approach is differently applied in different studies, and in some cases lacks a clear mapping between financial and software engineering concepts.

Conclusion
The results are expected to prove beneficial for the communication between technical managers and project managers, in the sense that they will provide a common vocabulary, and will help in setting up quality-related goals, during software development. To achieve this we introduce: (a) a glossary of terms and (b) a classification scheme for financial approaches used for managing technical debt. Based on these, we have been able to underline interesting implications for researchers and practitioners.},

To quantify such debts, we formally define architectural debt, and show how to automatically identify debts, quantify their maintenance costs, and model these costs over time. We describe a novel history coupling probability matrix for this purpose, and identify architecture debts using 4 patterns of architectural flaws shown to correlate with reduced software quality. We evaluate our approach on 7 large-scale open source projects, and show that a significant portion of total project maintenance effort is consumed by paying interest on architectural debts. The top 5 architectural debts, covering a small portion (8% to 25%) of each project's error-prone files, capture a significant portion (20% to 61%) of each project's maintenance effort. Finally, we show that our approach reveals how architectural issues evolve into debts over time.},

A known problem in large software companies is to balance the prioritization of short-term with long-term feature delivery speed. Specifically, Architecture Technical Debt is regarded as sub-optimal architectural solutions taken to deliver fast that might hinder future feature development, which, in turn, would hinder agility.

Objective
This paper aims at improving software management by shedding light on the current factors responsible for the accumulation of Architectural Technical Debt and to understand how it evolves over time.

Method
We conducted an exploratory multiple-case embedded case study in 7 sites at 5 large companies. We evaluated the results with additional cross-company interviews and an in-depth, company-specific case study in which we initially evaluate factors and models.

Results
We compiled a taxonomy of the factors and their influence in the accumulation of Architectural Technical Debt, and we provide two qualitative models of how the debt is accumulated and refactored over time in the studied companies. We also list a set of exploratory propositions on possible refactoring strategies that can be useful as insights for practitioners and as hypotheses for further research.

Conclusion
Several factors cause constant and unavoidable accumulation of Architecture Technical Debt, which leads to development crises. Refactorings are often overlooked in prioritization and they are often triggered by development crises, in a reactive fashion. Some of the factors are manageable, while others are external to the companies. ATD needs to be made visible, in order to postpone the crises according to the strategic goals of the companies. There is a need for practices and automated tools to proactively manage ATD.},

One indicator of ATD, is the average number of modified components per commit (ANMCC): a higher ANMCC indicates more ATD in a software system. However, it is difficult and sometimes impossible to calculate ANMCC, because the data (i.e., the log of commits) are not always available. In this work, we propose to use software modularity metrics, which can be directly calculated based on source code, as a substitute of ANMCC to indicate ATD. We validate the correlation between ANMCC and modularity metrics through a holistic multiple case study on thirteen open source software projects. The results of this study suggest that two modularity metrics, namely Index of Package Changing Impact (IPCI) and Index of Package Goal Focus (IPGF), have significant correlation with ANMCC, and therefore can be used as alternative ATD indicators.},

  abstract  = {Context
Research and industry's attention has been focusing on developing systems that enable fast time to market in the short term, but would assure a sustainable delivery of business value and maintenance operations in the long run. A related phenomenon has been identified in Architectural Technical Debt: if the system architecture is sub-optimal for long-term business goals, it might need to be refactored. A key property of the system assuring long-term goals is its modularity, or else the degree to which components are decoupled: such property allows the product to be evolved without costly changes pervading the whole system. However, understanding the business benefits of refactoring to achieve modularity is not trivial, especially for large refactorings involving substantial architectural changes.

Objective
The aim of this study was to develop a technique to identify Architectural Technical Debt in the form of a non-modularized component and to quantify the convenience of its repayment.

Method
We have conducted a single, embedded case study in a large company, comparing a component before and after it was refactored to achieve modularity. We have developed a holistic framework for the semi-automated identification and estimation of Architectural Technical Debt in the form of non-modularized components. We then evaluate the technique reporting a comparative study of the difference in maintenance and development costs in two coexisting systems, one including the refactored component and one including the non-refactored one.

Results
The main contributions are a measurement system for the identification of the Architectural Technical Debt according to the stakeholders’ goals, a mathematical relationship for calculating and quantifying its interest in terms of extra-effort spent in additional development and maintenance, and an overall decision framework to assess the benefit of refactoring. We also report context-specific results that show the estimated benefits of refactoring the specific case of Architectural Technical Debt.

Conclusion
We found that it is possible to identify this kind of Architectural Technical Debt and to quantify its repayment convenience. Thanks to the developed framework, it was possible to estimate that the Architectural Technical Debt present in the component was causing substantial continuous extra-effort, and that the modularization would be repaid in several months of development and maintenance.},

If architectural technical debt (ATD) is not effectively managed in the architecting process, the knowledge about ATD is not made available to involved stakeholders and the impact of ATD is not considered during architecture decision-making. Thus, the system’s maintainability and evolvability can be intentionally or unintentionally compromised. As a result, architectures are costly to maintain and new features are difficult to introduce. To facilitate the management of ATD, it needs to be documented so that it becomes explicit to stakeholders. To this end, we propose a set of architecture viewpoints related to ATD (ATD viewpoints in short). Each viewpoint frames a number of concerns related to ATD. These ATD viewpoints together help to get a comprehensive understanding of ATD in a software system, thereby providing support for architecture decision-making. To evaluate the effectiveness of the ATD viewpoints in documenting ATD, we conducted a case study in a large telecommunications company. The results of this case study show that the documented ATD views can effectively facilitate the documentation of ATD. Specifically, the ATD viewpoints are relatively easy to understand; it takes an acceptable amount of effort to document ATD using the ATD viewpoints; and the documented ATD views are useful for stakeholders to understand the ATD in the software project.},

  abstract  = {Background:
Using a microservices architecture is a popular strategy for software organizations to deliver value to their customers fast and continuously. However, scientific knowledge on how to manage architectural debt in microservices is scarce.

Objectives:
In the context of microservices applications, this paper aims to identify architectural technical debts (ATDs), their costs, and their most common solutions.

Method:
We conducted an exploratory multiple case study by conducting 25 interviews with practitioners working with microservices in seven large companies.

Results:
We found 16 ATD issues, their negative impact (interest), and common solutions to repay each debt together with the related costs (principal). Two examples of critical ATD issues found were the use of shared databases that, if not properly planned, leads to potential breaks on services every time the database schema changes and bad API designs, which leads to coupling among teams. We identified ATDs occurring in different domains and stages of development and created a map of the relationships among those debts.

Conclusion:
The findings may guide organizations in developing microservices systems that better manage and avoid architectural debts.},

Although a great deal of theoretical work on Architectural Technical Debt has been undertaken, there is a lack of empirical studies that examine the negative effects of Architectural Technical Debt during the software development lifecycle. The aim of this study is to investigate how practitioners perceive and estimate the impact of Architectural Technical Debt during the software development process. This paper reports the results of an online web survey providing quantitative data from 258 participants. The contribution of this paper is threefold: First, it shows that practitioners experience that the Architectural type of Technical Debt has the highest negative impact on daily software development work. Secondly, we provide evidence that does not support the commonly held belief that Architectural Technical Debt increases with the age of the software. Thirdly, we show that despite different responsibilities and working tasks of software professionals, Architectural Technical Debt negatively affects all roles without any significant difference between the roles.},

Objectives: The aim of this study is to identify issues, solutions and risks related to Architecture Technical Debt in microservices. Method: We conducted an exploratory case study of a real life project with about 1000 services in a large, international company. Through qualitative analysis of documents and interviews, we investigated Architecture Technical Debt in the communication layer of a system with microservices architecture. Results: Our main contributions are a list of Architecture Technical Debt issues specific for the communication layer in a system with microservices architecture, as well as their associated negative impact (interest), a solution to repay the debt and the its cost (principal). Among the found Architecture Technical Debt issues were the existence of business logic in the communication layer and a high amount of point-to-point connections between services. The studied solution consists of the implementation of different canonical models specific to different domains, the removal of business logic from the communication layer, and migration from services to use the communication layer correctly. We also contributed with a list of possible risks that can affect the payment of the debt, as lack of funding and inadequate prioritization. Conclusion: We found issues, solutions and possible risks that are specific for microservices architectures not yet encountered in the current literature. Our results may be useful for practitioners that want to avoid or repay Technical Debt in their microservices architecture.},

Project Managers tend to delay paying off this debt because they face difficulties in comparing the cost of the refactoring against the benefits gained. These managers need to estimate the cost and the efforts required to conduct these refactoring activities as well as to decide which flaws have higher priority to be refactored.

Our research is based on a dataset used by other researchers that study the technical debt. It includes more than 18,000 refactoring operations performed on 33 apache java projects. We applied the COCOMO II:2000 model to calculate the refactoring cost in person-months units per release. Furthermore, we investigated the correlation between the refactoring efforts and two static code metrics of the refactored code. The research revealed a weak correlation between the refactoring efforts and the size of the project, and a moderate correlation with the code complexity. Finally, we applied the DesigniteJava tool to verify our research results. From the analysis we found a significant correlation between the ranking of the architecture smells and the ranking of refactoring efforts for each package. Using machine learning practices, we took the architecture smells level and the code metrics of each release as an input to predict the levels of the refactoring effort of the next release. We calculated the results using our model and found that we can predict the ‘High’ and ‘Very High’ levels, the most significant levels from managers’ perspective, with 93% accuracy.},

Method: A mixed-methods approach with 40 software practitioners from 12 companies was used, combining repeated measurements laboratory experiments and semi-structured interviews. Result: Based on a set of 200 data points, the existence of tiny tangles negatively impacts the valence of software practitioners with more than 99 % certainty.

Moreover, software practitioners receive positive affects from challenging software engineering tasks and negative affects from architectural technical debt and deadlines.

  year={0},
  abstract = {problem and motivation
A known problem in large software companies is to balance the prioritization of
short-term with long-term responsiveness. To illustrate such a phenomenon, a
financial metaphor has been coined, which relates taking sub-optimal decisions in
order to meet short-term goals to taking a financial debt, which has to be repaid with
interests in the long term. Such a concept is referred to as Technical Debt (TD), and
recently it has been recognized as a useful basis for the development of theoretical
and practical frameworks (Kruchten et al., 2012). Tom et al. (Tom et al., 2013) have
explored the TD metaphor and outlined a first framework in 2013. Part of the overall
TD is to be related to architecture sub-optimal decisions, and it’s regarded as
Architecture Technical Debt (ADT). ATD is regarded as violations in the code
towards an intended architecture.
The problem of visualizing and communicating the ATD is particularly relevant
for large companies, where the architecture documentation is not capable of capturing
all the updated information for compliance checking of the source code. It’s therefore
difficult, both for software architects and managers not involved directly in the
development of parts of the system, to monitor and understand the level of current
ATD. This, in turn, affects negatively their ability of taking informed decision about
the prioritization of architectural improvements and refactorings and about estimating
the time needed for product development.
ATD has been recognized as part of TD, but the specific phenomenon of
accumulation of ATD, its recovery to avoid the later payment of interest (in terms of
effort) and the impact (effects) of such interest in future development has not been
tackled yet.},

Similarly, most visualisation of software architecture target lower level artifacts based on static code analysis. Therefore there is a gap in both addressing architectural technical debt and software visualisation on a more abstract level. By utilizing a case study at a company, followed by design research, we contribute to filling this gap by identifying, measuring, and visualizing architectural debt on a higher abstraction level.

  abstract = {Technical debt refers to sub-optimal solutions during software development where there is a trade-o between short-term and long-term goals. Lately there has been a few studies which identi es technical debt, however most of the do not estimate the interest which is associated with the identi ed debt. Knowing how much interest is being paid allows the developers to make informed decisions of what will bene t the development. One example is knowing if a onetime cost of a repaying the debt outweighs the cost of paying the interest of that debt. This would mean that the repayment can be seen as an investment for future development. This thesis aims to develop a decision framework that can be used when deciding if part of a component would bene t from being modularized into a new component or framework to repay a debt. To accomplish this, the study developed two methods that are used by the decision framework. The rst method is to nd out if the analysed part of the components would bene t from such a modularization. The second method estimates how much e ort can be saved by doing a modularization. It was found that for the rst method, a measurement system which analysed the component's source code was a good approach in deciding if a modularization would be bene cial. For the second method an approach which used data regarding the current e ort distribution to estimate the e ort saved by modularizing was chosen. The result of combining the two methods was found to be an adequate decision framework which provides useful information in the decision if to modularize part of a component or not.},

  abstract = {Context: The Technical Debt metaphor has grown in popularity. More software is being created and has to be maintained. Agile methodologies, in particular Scrum, are widely used by development teams around the world. Estimation is an often practised step in sprint planning. The subject matter of this paper is the impact technical debt has on estimations. Objective: The goal of this research is to identify estimation problems and their solutions due to previously introduced technical debt in software projects. Method: The Systematic mapping study (SMS) method was applied in the research. Papers were selected from the popular digital databases (IEEE, ACM, Scopus, etc.) using defined search criteria. Afterwards, a snowballing procedure was performed and the final publication set was filtered using inclusion/exclusion criteria. Results: 42 studies were selected and evaluated. Five categories of problems and seven proposed solutions to the problems have been extracted from the papers. Problems include items related to business perspective (delivery pressure or lack of technical debt understanding by business decision-makers) and technical perspective (difficulties in forecasting architectural technical debt impact or limits of source code analysis). Solutions were categorized in: more sophisticated decision-making tools for business managers, better tools for estimation support and technical debt management tools on an architectural-level, portfolio approach to technical debt, code audit and technical debt reduction routine conducted every sprint. Conclusion: The results of this mapping study can help taking the appropriate approach in technical debt mitigation in organizations. However, the outcome of the conducted research shows that the problem of measuring technical debt impact on estimations has not yet been solved. We propose several directions for further investigation. In particular, we would focus on more sophisticated decision-making tools.},

In this paper, we emphasize the change in scalability requirements due to new regulations. Scalability is the ability of a system to handle an increased workload. For complex systems that are abruptly exposed via open interfaces and hence a greater workload, the scalability requirements may quickly increase, leading to technical debt. We term this scalability debt. This paper describes scalability triage, a light-weight, novel technique for identifying scalability threats as a form of technical debt. We illustrate this technique with an open banking case from a large software organization. Open banking is partly caused by the new European PSD2 regulative that enforce banks to open interfaces to unknown third-party actors. Banking systems are well-established, mature systems. However, with the advent of open banking and PSD2, the workload may quickly rocket. This leads to tougher scalability requirements and accumulated architectural debt, despite previously sound architectural decisions. Using scalability triage, such risks may be identified fast. It will then be possible to prevent this form of technical debt with timely reengineering.},

Although unmanaged debt can have disastrous results, strategically managed debt can help businesses and organizations take advantage of time-sensitive opportunities, fulfill market needs and acquire stakeholder feedback. Because architecture has such leverage within the overall development life cycle, strategic management of architectural debt is of primary importance. Some aspects of technical debt - but not all technical debt - affects product quality. This tutorial introduces the technical debt metaphor, the various types of technical debt, and in particular structural or architectural debt, the techniques for measuring and communicating this technical debt, and its relationship with software quality, both internal and external quality.},

In addition, technical debt management offers a logical approach to tracking expedient decisions and determining when it makes sense to carry the debt and when it's better to pay it off by updating designed and retrofitting units. In this paper, we describe various kinds of technical debt that may be present in a system baseline and consider how the presence of debt impacts further evolution of the system. Types of debt include architectural debt, configuration debt, testing debt and deprecation debt among others. We also present use case studies that illustrate how technical debt assessment and management can have a positive impact on system realization. Cases include moving a baseline from R&D to operations, reusing a baseline in a new context, and planning a technical refresh. We discuss methods of managing technical debt in a baseline including identification, quantification, tracking and payoff.},

During software development, some architectural design decisions incur technical debt, either deliberately or inadvertently. These have serious impact on the quality of a software system, and can cost significant time and effort to be changed. While current research efforts have explored general concepts of architectural design decisions and technical debt separately, debt-incurring architectural design decisions have not been specifically explored in practice.

Objective:
In this case study, we explore debt-incurring architectural design decisions (DADDs) in practice. Specifically, we explore the main types of DADDs, why and how they are incurred in a software system, and how practitioners deal with these types of design decisions.

Method:
We performed interviews and a focus group with practitioners working in embedded and enterprise software companies, discussing their concrete experience with such architectural design decisions.

Results:
We provide the following contributions: 1) A categorization for the types of DADDs, which extend a current ontology on architectural design decisions. 2) A process on how deliberate DADDs are made in practice. 3) A conceptual model which shows the relationships between the causes and triggers of inadvertent DADDs. 4) The main factors that influence the way of dealing with DADDs.},

To accomplish this task, we used a survey research method to collect and analyze a corpus of 28 software architects from Colombia, as a part of the InsighTD project. Results showed that inappropriate planning is the most cited technical debt cause by software architects. However, results differ when comparison against engineers and manager are performed. Innacurate time estimate and producing more without quality were the most selected causes of technical debt according to engineers and managers. To improve this comparison, the rank-biased overlapping technique was used. As more elements were compared, more similar were these lists of causes among all three roles.},

In recent research it was shown that the amount of architecture debt has a huge impact on software maintainability and evolution. Consequently, reducing debt is expected to make software less costly and more amenable to change. This paper reports on a longitudinal study of a healthcare communications product created by BrightSquid Secure Communications Corp. This young company is facing the typical trade-off problem of desiring responsiveness to change requests, but wanting to avoid the ever-increasing effort that the accumulation of quick-and-dirty changes eventually incurs. In the first stage of the study, we analyzed the status of the "before" system, which showed the impacts of change requests. This initial study motivated a more in-depth analysis of architecture debt. The results of this debt analysis were used in the second stage of the work to motivate a comprehensive refactoring of the software system. The third stage was a follow-on architecture debt analysis which quantified the improvements realized. Using this quantitative evidence, augmented by qualitative evidence gathered from in-depth interviews with BrightSquid's architects, we present lessons learned about the costs and benefits of paying down architecture debt in practice.},

Software evolves continuously, through numerous issues, fixing bugs and adding new features, and architecture flaws emerge quietly and largely unnoticed until they grow in scope and significance when the system becomes difficult to maintain. Developers are largely unaware of these flaws or the accumulating debt as they are focused on their immediate tasks of address individual issues. As a consequence, the cumulative impacts of their activities, as they affect the architecture, go unnoticed. To detect these problems early and prevent them from accumulating into severe ones we propose to monitor software evolution by tracking the interactions among files revised to address issues. In particular, we propose and show how we can automatically detect active hotspots, to reveal architecture problems. We have studied hundreds of hotspots along the evolution timelines of 21 open source projects and showed that there exist just a few dominating active hotspots per project at any given time. Moreover, these dominating active hotspots persist over long time periods, and thus deserve special attention. Compared with state-of-the-art design and code smell detection tools we report that, using active hotspots, it is possible to detect signs of software degradation both earlier and more precisely.},

Once defined architectural rules can be checked and enforced in an automated way in all stages of the development process. This guarantees that a software system will never end up as the notorious "big ball of mud".

A related phenomenon has been identified in Architectural Technical Debt: if the system architecture is sub-optimal for long-term business goals, it needs to be refactored. A key property of the system assuring long-term goals consists on modularity, or else the ability to decouple different components: such property allows the product to be evolved without costly changes pervading the whole system. However, understanding the business benefits of refactoring to achieve modularity is not trivial, especially for large refactorings involving substantial architectural changes. We have conducted a case study in a large company, analyzing a case of refactoring a component to achieve modularity. We report a comparative study of a refactored against a non-refactored component. We found that the modularization would be repaid in several months of development and maintenance. We present a method to calculate the effort saved by the modularization and an equation for calculating and quantifying the development and maintenance benefits of refactoring.},

We use DRSpaces to split a complex system into smaller subsystems based on features, patterns, refactoring targets, etc., so that we can monitor and analyze the evolution and interaction of each subsystem separately. We also employ a recently proposed architectural metric---Decoupling Level---to quantitatively monitor changes in a project's overall level of architecture maintainability.

For instance, certain modules might become coupled due to a new user feature being added or to suboptimal development decisions. Design degradation symptoms are often related to high coupling and unwanted dependencies, such as: cyclic dependencies or violations to design rules, amongst other architectural smells. Thus, the early detection of such symptoms is important for architects to: i) anticipate dependency-related design problems in different parts of the system, ii) assess possible situations of technical debt, and iii) proactively look for solutions to preserve the quality of the system. Although there are approaches that analyse design dependencies in code bases and flag smell occurrences, very few of them have dealt with the prediction of dependency relations amongst software components. This research hypothesises that a predictive approach can warn architects about dependency-related problems before they appear. To this end, a particular graph-based approach is social networks analysis (SNA), which has been used for modelling both nature and human phenomena. Specifically, SNA techniques can predict links that do not yet exist between pairs of nodes in a network. SNA applications have shown evidence that the topological features of dependency graphs can reveal interesting properties of the software system under analysis. Nonetheless, SNA techniques have not yet been extensively exploited in the Software Architecture community. In this context, the question that motivates this research is to what extent SNA can leverage on information from a software design (and its evolution over time) for inferring new dependencies and likely configurations of architectural smells out of those dependencies.},

  abstract  = {Architectural smells represent symptoms of problems at architectural level that can negatively impact internal software qualities and lead to architectural debt. Detecting architectural smells and identifying the most critical ones is the key to prioritize refactoring efforts and prevent software architecture erosion. In this paper we focus our attention on three architectural smells based on dependency issues, called Cyclic Dependency, Unstable Dependency, and Hub-Like Dependency. Moreover, we evaluate the PageRank and Criticality of these smells through the analysis of six projects. PageRank is a measure that estimates whether an architectural smell is located in an important part of the project, where the importance is evaluated according to how many parts of a project depend on the one involved in the architectural smell. We describe a case study on the analysis of the possible relation existing between the PageRank and Criticality of the smells. The results show how the two measures can be both used to locate the architectural smells that need particular inspections and attention.},

  abstract  = {Unix has evolved for almost five decades, shaping modern operating systems, key software technologies, and development practices. Studying the evolution of this remarkable system from an architectural perspective can provide insights on how to manage the growth of large, complex, and long-lived software systems. Along main Unix releases leading to the FreeBSD lineage we examine core architectural design decisions, the number of features, and code complexity, based on the analysis of source code, reference documentation, and related publications. We report that the growth in size has been uniform, with some notable outliers, while cyclomatic complexity has been religiously safeguarded. A large number of Unix-defining design decisions were implemented right from the very early beginning, with most of them still playing a major role. Unix continues to evolve from an architectural perspective, but the rate of architectural innovation has slowed down over the system's lifetime. Architectural technical debt has accrued in the forms of functionality duplication and unused facilities, but in terms of cyclomatic complexity it is systematically being paid back through what appears to be a self-correcting process. Some unsung architectural forces that shaped Unix are the emphasis on conventions over rigid enforcement, the drive for portability, a sophisticated ecosystem of other operating systems and development organizations, and the emergence of a federated architecture, often through the adoption of third-party subsystems. These findings have led us to form an initial theory on the architecture evolution of large, complex operating system software.},

In this paper we investigate the state of practice in several companies in order to understand how they start tracking Technical Debt. We combined different methodologies: we conducted a survey, involving 226 respondents from 15 organizations and a more in-depth multiple case-study in three organizations, where Technical Debt was tracked: we involved 13 interviews and 79 Technical Debt issues analysis. We found that the development time dedicated to manage Technical Debt is substantial (around 25% of the overall development) but not systematic: only a few participants methodically track Technical Debt. By studying the approaches in the companies participating in the case-study, we understood how companies start tracking Technical Debt and what are the initial benefits and challenges. Finally, we propose a Strategic Adoption Model based to define and adopt a dedicated process for tracking Technical Debt.},

The relationship between SW architecture design and requirements volatility has not been researched widely, even though changing requirements may for example lead to higher defect density during testing. An exploratory case study was conducted to study how requirements volatility affects SW architecture design. Fifteen semi-structured, thematic interviews were conducted in the case company, which provides the selection of software products for business customers and consumers. The research revealed the factors, such as requirements uncertainty and dynamic business environment, causing requirements volatility in the case company. The study identified the challenges that requirements volatility posed to SW architecture design, including scheduling and architectural technical debt. In addition, this study discusses means of mitigating the factors that cause requirements volatility and addressing the challenges posed by requirements volatility. SW architects are strongly influenced by requirement volatility. Thus understanding the factors causing requirements volatility as well as means to mitigate the challenges has high industrial relevance.},

We model the architecture of a software system as multiple overlapping DRSpaces, reflecting the fact that any complex software system must contain multiple aspects, features, patterns, etc. We show that this model provides new ways to analyze software quality. In particular, we introduce an Architecture Root detection algorithm that captures DRSpaces containing large numbers of a project's bug-prone files, which are called Architecture Roots (ArchRoots). After investigating ArchRoots calculated from 15 open source projects, the following observations become clear: from 35 to 91 percent of a project's most bug-prone files can be captured by just 5 ArchRoots, meaning that bug-prone files are likely to be architecturally connected. Furthermore, these ArchRoots tend to live in the system for significant periods of time, serving as the major source of bug-proneness and high maintainability costs. Moreover, each ArchRoot reveals multiple architectural flaws that propagate bugs among files and this will incur high maintenance costs over time. The implication of our study is that the quality, in terms of bug-proneness, of a large, complex software project cannot be fundamentally improved without first fixing its architectural flaws.},

In 17 semi-structured interviews, we discussed 14 different Microservice-based systems with software professionals from 10 companies and how the sustainable evolution of these systems was ensured. Interview transcripts were analyzed with a detailed coding system and the constant comparison method. We found that especially systems for external customers relied on central governance for the assurance. Participants saw guidelines like architectural principles as important to ensure a base consistency for evolvability. Interviewees also valued manual activities like code review, even though automation and tool support was described as very important. Source code quality was the primary target for the usage of tools and metrics. Despite most reported issues being related to Architectural Technical Debt (ATD), our participants did not apply any architectural or service-oriented tools and metrics. While participants generally saw their Microservices as evolvable, service cutting and finding an appropriate service granularity with low coupling and high cohesion were reported as challenging. Future Microservices research in the areas of evolution and technical debt should take these findings and industry sentiments into account.},

These design flaws can originate from quick fixes, hacks or shortcuts to a solution, hence they can be seen as Technical Debt. Recently, new work has focused on studying source code comments that indicate Technical Debt, i.e., Self-Admitted Technical Debt (SATD). However, it is not known if addressing information left by developers in the form source code comments can give insight about the design flaws in a system and have the potential to provide fixes for bad architectural implementations. This paper investigates the possibility of using SATD comments to resolve architectural divergences. We leverage a data set of previously classified SATD comments to trace them to the architectural divergences of a large open source system, namely ArgoUML. We extract its conceptual and concrete architectures based on available design documentation and source code, and contrast both to expose divergences, trace them to SATD comments, and investigate their resolution. We found 7 high-level divergences in ArgoUML and 22 others among its subsystems, observing that merely 4 out of 29 (14%) divergences can be directly traced to SATD. Although using SATD as an indicator of architectural divergences is viable, the effort of doing so is time-intensive, and in general, will not lend to a significant reduction of architectural flaws in a software system.},

  abstract  = {Background: A consistent body of research and practice have identified that technical debt provides valuable and actionable insight into the design and implementation deficiencies of complex software systems. Existing software tools enable characterizing and measuring the amount of technical debt at selective granularity levels; by providing a computational model, they enable stakeholders to measure and ultimately control this phenomenon. Aims: In this paper we aim to study the evolution and characteristics of technical debt in open-source software. For this, we carry out a longitudinal study that covers the entire development history of several complex applications. The goal is to improve our understanding of how the amount and composition of technical debt changes in evolving software. We also study how new technical debt is introduced in software, as well as identify how developers handle its accumulation over the long term. Method: We carried out our evaluation using three complex, open-source Java applications. All 110 released versions, covering more than 10 years of development history for each application were analyzed using SonarQube. We studied how the amount, composition and history of technical debt changed during development, compared our results across the studied applications and present our most important findings. Results: For each application, we identified key versions during which large amounts of technical debt were added, removed or both. This had significantly more impact when compared to the lines of code or class count increases that generally occurred during development. However, within each version, we found high correlation between file lines of code and technical debt. We observed that the Pareto principle was satisfied for the studied applications, as 20% of issue types generated around 80% of total technical debt. Interestingly, there was a large degree of overlap between the issues that generated most of the debt across the studied applications. Conclusions: Early application versions showed greater fluctuation in the amount of existing technical debt. We found application size to be an unreliable predictor for the quantity of technical debt. Most debt was introduced in applications as part of milestone releases that expanded their feature set; likewise, we identified releases where extensive refactoring significantly reduced the level of debt. We also discovered that technical debt issues persist for a long time in source code, and their removal did not appear to be prioritized according to type or severity.},

To ensure that software remains useful, new features have to be added or old features have to be adapted to respond to new or changed requirements.

Typically, these features are not removed because of various reasons, e.g., because removing them might be considered too costly, the costs of keeping unused features is considered low, or because of the "sunk cost fallacy", i.e., that a feature is considered worth to keep because of the previously invested resources (time, money or effort) to build it. The consequences of keeping unused source code can impact maintainability, technical debt, performance, and extensibility of the system. This can lead to lower development productivity and to a reduced innovation ability, consequently reducing competitiveness on the market. This paper aims to present an approach to identify features based on their value and on costs for keeping or removing them.},

  abstract  = {Modularity is one of the four key principles of software design and architecture. According to this principle, software should be organized into modules that are tightly linked internally (high cohesion), whereas at the same time as independent from other modules as possible (low coupling). However, in practice, this principle is violated due to poor architecting design decisions, lack of time, or coding shortcuts, leading to a phenomenon termed as architectural technical debt (ATD). To alleviate this problem (lack of architectural modularity), the most common solution is the application of a software refactoring, namely Move Class—i.e., moving classes (the core artifact in object-oriented systems) from one module to another. To identify Move Class refactoring opportunities, we employ a search-based optimization process, relying on optimization metrics, through which optimal moves are derived. Given the extensive search space required for applying a brute-force search strategy, in this paper, we propose the use of a genetic algorithm that re-arranges existing software classes into existing or new modules (software packages in Java, or folders in C++). To validate the usefulness of the proposed refactorings, we performed an industrial case study on three projects (from the Aviation, Healthcare, and Manufacturing application domains). The results of the study indicate that the proposed architecture reconstruction is able to improve modularity, improving both coupling and cohesion. The obtained results can be useful to practitioners through an open source tool; whereas at the same point, they open interesting future work directions.},

Since the abstractions and the relationships provided by MAPE-K are generic, other reference models were proposed focusing on providing lower level abstractions to support software engineers in a more suitable way. However, after the analysis of seven representative ASs, we realized the abstractions prescribed by the existing reference models are not properly implemented, thus leading to architectural drifts. Therefore, in this paper we characterized three of these drifts by describing them with a template and showing practical examples. The three architectural drifts of ASs are Scattered Reference Inputs, Mixed Executors and Effectors, and Obscure Alternatives. We expect that by identifying and characterizing these drifts, we can help software architects improve their design and, as a consequence, increase the reliability of this type of systems.},

We interviewed practitioners from four large international companies involved in microservices projects to identify problems when using shared libraries. Our results show that the participating companies had issues with shared libraries as follows: coupling among teams, delays on fixes due to overhead on libraries development teams, and need to maintain many versions of the libraries. Our results highlight that the use of shared libraries may hinder agility on microservices. Thus, their use should be restricted to situations where shared libraries cannot be replaced by a microservice and the costs of replicating the code on each service is very high.},

  abstract  = {Architectural technical debt in software-intensive systems is a metaphor used to describe the “big” design decisions (e.g., choices regarding structure, frameworks, technologies, languages, etc.) that, while being suitable or even optimal when made, significantly hinder progress in the future. While other types of debt, such as code-level technical debt, can be readily detected by static analyzers, and often be refactored with minimal or only incremental efforts, architectural debt is hard to be identified, of wide-ranging remediation cost, daunting, and often avoided.

In this study, we aim at developing a better understanding of how software development organizations conceptualize architectural debt, and how they deal with it. In order to do so, in this investigation we apply a mixed empirical method, constituted by a grounded theory study followed by focus groups. With the grounded theory method we construct a theory on architectural technical debt by eliciting qualitative data from software architects and senior technical staff from a wide range of heterogeneous software development organizations. We applied the focus group method to evaluate the emerging theory and refine it according to the new data collected.

The result of the study, i.e., a theory emerging from the gathered data, constitutes an encompassing conceptual model of architectural technical debt, identifying and relating concepts such as its symptoms, causes, consequences, management strategies, and communication problems. From the conducted focus groups, we assessed that the theory adheres to the four evaluation criteria of classic grounded theory, i.e., the theory fits its underlying data, is able to work, has relevance, and is modifiable as new data appears.

By grounding the findings in empirical evidence, the theory provides researchers and practitioners with novel knowledge on the crucial factors of architectural technical debt experienced in industrial contexts.},

  abstract  = {Background
Architectural Technical Debt (ATD) in a software-intensive system denotes architectural design choices which, while being suitable or even optimal when adopted, lower the maintainability and evolvability of the system in the long term, hindering future development activities. Despite the growing research interest in ATD, how to gain an informative and encompassing viewpoint of the ATD present in a software-intensive system is still an open problem.

Objective
In this study, we evaluate ATDx, a data-driven approach providing an overview of the ATD present in a software-intensive system. The approach, based on the analysis of a software portfolio, calculates severity levels of architectural rule violations via a clustering algorithm, and aggregates results into different ATD dimensions.

Method
To evaluate ATDx, we implement an instance of the approach based on SonarQube, and run the analysis on the Apache and ONAP ecosystems. The analysis results are then shared with the portfolio contributors, who are invited to participate in an online survey designed to evaluate the representativeness and actionability of the approach.

Results
The survey results confirm the representativeness of the ATDx, in terms of both the ATDx analysis results and the used architectural technical debt dimensions. Results also showed the actionability of the approach, although to a lower extent when compared to the ATDx representativeness, with usage scenarios including refactoring, code review, communication, and ATD evolution analysis.

Conclusions
With ATDx, we strive for the establishment of a sound, comprehensive, and intuitive architectural view of the ATD identifiable via source code analysis. The collected results are promising, and display both the representativeness and actionability of the approach. As future work, we plan to consolidate the approach via further empirical experimentation, by considering other development contexts (e.g., proprietary portfolios and other source code analysis tools), and enhancing the ATDx report capabilities.},

issue severity calculation via clustering, and aggregation of measurements into different architectural
technical debt dimensions. The ATDx tool allows users to automatically run the ATDx analysis, generate reports containing the ATDx analysis results, and is integrated with GitHub. In addition to the tool,
we provide two already implemented plugins, allowing users to run the ATDx tool out-of-the-box.

  abstract     = {Architectural technical debt (ATD) may create a substantial extra effort in software development, which is called interest. There is little evidence about whether repaying ATD in microservices reduces such interest. Objectives: We wanted to conduct a first study on investigating the effect of removing ATD on the occurrence of incidents in a microservices architecture. Method: We conducted a quantitative and qualitative case study of a project with approximately 1000 microservices in a large, international financing services company. We measured and compared the number of software incidents of different categories before and after repaying ATD. Results: The total number of incidents was reduced by 84%, and the numbers of critical- and high-priority incidents were both reduced by approximately 90% after the architectural refactoring. The number of incidents in the architecture with the ATD was mainly constant over time, but we observed a slight increase of low priority incidents related to inaccessibility and the environment in the architecture without the ATD. Conclusion: This study shows evidence that refactoring ATDs, such as lack of communication standards, poor management of dead-letter queues, and the use of inadequate technologies in microservices, reduces the number of critical- and high-priority incidents and, thus, part of its interest, although some low priority incidents may increase.},

ATD concerns the overall structure and architecture of a softwareintensive system and can be described as the unresolved shortcuts developers take under circumstances of e.g. time pressure and uncertain requirements. Planning and constructing a well-thought-out architecture is time consuming and resource-intensive
and if not done carefully, it can cause ATD. This thesis aims to investigate if it is possible to prevent the rise of ATD with a software project generator and how to maintain it. We have carried out a study following the design science research paradigm at a case company, Jayway by Devoteam. We conducted both literature and empirical studies to
better understand the current situation at the case company and based on that proposed a feasible solution. According to our findings, a project generator tool can mitigate the causes of ATD at the beginning of a project. However, ATD can be introduced later on due to various factors, for instance negligence of best practices. Moreover, we concluded that the most suitable way for maintaining such a tool is adopting Inner Source.},

However, reusing software opportunistically can lead to a loss of quality and induce TD, especially when the architecture is changed in the process. However, to the best of our knowledge, no studies have investigated the impact of opportunistic reuse in TD. In this paper, we carry out an exploratory study to investigate to what extent reusing components opportunistically negatively affects the quality of systems.

  abstract  = {Context:
Architectural decisions are considered one of the most common sources of technical debt (TD). Thus, it is necessary to understand how TD is perceived by software architects, particularly, the practices supporting the elimination of debt items from projects, and the practices used to reduce the chances of TD occurrence.

Objective:
This paper investigates the most commonly used practices to pay off TD and to prevent debt occurrence in software projects from the architect’s point of view.

Method:
We used the available data from InsighTD, which is a globally distributed family of industrial surveys on the causes, effects, and management of TD. We analyze responses from a corpus of 72 software architects from Brazil, Chile, Colombia, and the United States.

Results:
Results showed that refactoring (30.2%) was the main practice related to TD payment, followed by design improvements (14.0%). Refactoring, design improvements, and test improvements are the most cited payment practices among cases of code, design and test debt. Concerning the TD preventive practices, we find that having a well-defined architecture and design is the most cited practice (13.6%), followed by having a well-defined scope and requirements. This last practice is the most cited one for expert software architects. Finally, when comparing preventive practices among the three major roles derived from the survey (software architects, engineer roles, and management roles), we found that none of the roles shared the most cited practice, meaning that each role had its worries and focus on different strategies to reduce TD’s presence in the software.

Conclusion:
The lists of TD payment and prevention practices can guide software teams by having a catalog of practices to keep debt controlled or reduced.},

  abstract  = {Many companies migrate to microservices because they help deliver value to customers quickly and continuously. However, like any architectural style, microservices are prone to architectural technical debt (ATD), which can be costly if the debts are not timely identified, avoided, or removed. During the early stages of migration, microservice-specific ATDs may accumulate. For example, practitioners may decide to continue using poorly defined APIs in microservices while attempting to maintain compatibility with old functionalities. The riskiest ATDs must be prioritized. Nevertheless, there is limited research regarding the prioritization of ATDs in companies migrating to microservices. This study aims to identify, during migration, which microservice-specific ATDs occur, are the most severe, and are the most challenging to solve. In addition, we propose a way to prioritize these debts. We conducted a multiple exploratory case study of three large companies that were early in the migration process to microservices. We interviewed 47 practitioners with several roles to identify the debts in their contexts.We report the ATDs detected during migration, the ATDs that practitioners estimate to occur in the future, and the ATDs that practitioners report as difficult to solve. We discuss the results in the context of the companies involved in this study. In addition, we used a risk assessment approach to propose a way for prioritizing ATDs. Practitioners from other organizations and researchers may use this approach to provide rankings to help identify and prioritize which ATDs should be avoided or solved in their contexts.},

This work aims at finding technical debt prioritization methods, providing a classification of them. That is, methods to identify whether and when a technical debt should be paid off. We performed a systematic mapping review to find and analyze the main papers of the area, covering the main bases. We selected 112 studies, resulting in 51 unique papers. We classified the methods in a two-level taxonomy containing 10 categories according to their different possible outcomes. In addition, we have identified three methods results: boolean, category and ordered list. Finally, we have also identified practical technical characteristics and requirements for a method to prioritize technical debt items in real projects. Although several methods have been found in literature, none of them are adaptive to the context and are language-independent, nor cover several technical debt types. Moreover, there is a clear lack of tools to use them. So, in conclusion, the research on technical debt prioritization is still wide open. From this study, a combination of the techniques used in these methods can be tested and automated to assist in the decision-making process on which debts should be paid.},

  abstract = {Degraded software usually incurs higher energy consumption, therefore suboptimal decisions in software architectures may lead to higher technical debt and less sustainable software products. There are metrics and tools to calculate technical debt and energy consumption of software, but it is required to provide mechanisms to store their relationship and how they change depending on the design decisions. In addition, there are different models for calculating the same metric and different metrics to measure technical debt and power consumption, and software engineers require selecting the most suitable model and metric depending on the software product context. This work presents a metamodel called ARCMEL to provide the required base of knowledge for supporting green-aware design decisions and to flexibly configure and select metrics and their models. ARCMEL has been implemented as part of the ARCMEL SCAT tool. Its validation is also presented in terms of completeness and flexibility.},

Studying this impact would help to understand how much technical debt interest is being paid due to the existence of architecture smells and how this interest can be calculated. This work is a first attempt to address this issue by investigating the relation between architecture smells and source code changes. Specifically, we study whether the frequency and size of changes are correlated with the presence of a selected set of architectural smells. We detect architectural smells using the Arcan tool, which detects architectural smells by building a dependency graph of the system analyzed and then looking for the typical structures of the architectural smells. The findings, based on a case study of 31 open-source Java systems, show that 87% of the analyzed commits present more changes in artifacts with at least one smell, and the likelihood of changing increases with the number of smells. Moreover, there is also evidence to confirm that change frequency increases after the introduction of a smell and that the size of changes is also larger in smelly artifacts. These findings hold true especially in Medium–Large and Large artifacts.},

in the software development process for short-term benefit, at the expense of
higher maintenance in the future. Every large software system contains Technical
Debt in some way or another, the dicult question is to know when, where, and
how to repay the debt.
To answer this we conducted three main steps. A literature study on how
to identify, measure, and manage Technical Debt (i), interviews (ii), and finding
key software metrics based on the Goal-Question-Metric paradigm to build a
Technical Debt Model with a visualisation dashboard (iii). This was used for
a case study at an organisation where files from two projects were analysed and
the model was evaluated by comparing the results with opinions from developers
who created the system.
The final model used 8 metrics as input and had a total success rate of 80%
when comparing the model’s ranking with mutual opinion of the developers.
The dashboard was seen to be a useful tool for discussion and a quick way
to identify areas in the code with Technical Debt. It was also discovered that
measuring Technical Debt with only software metrics is a hard to impossible task,
and many sources of information must be used in conjunction. To circumvent
this, an implementation model for the organisation using several information
channels together with the dashboard was created},

Our case study shows that the presence of Code Technical Debt did not affect the lead time for resolving the issues.Conclusion: Future works include the further refinement of this approach and its application to a larger data-set and on different type of issues.},

  abstract  = {Architectural Technical Debt (ATD) refers to sub-optimal architectural design in a software system that incurs high maintenance ``interest" over time. Previous research revealed that ATD has significant negative impact on daily development. This paper contributes an approach to enable an architect to precisely locate ATDs, as well as capture the trajectory of maintenance cost on each debt, based on which, predict the cost of the debt in a future release. The ATDs are expressed in four typical patterns, which entail the core of each debt. Furthermore, we aggregate compound ATDs to capture the complicated relationship among multiple ATD instances, which should be examined together for effective refactoring solutions. We evaluate our approach on 18 real-world projects. We identified ATDs that persistently incur significant (up to 95% of) maintenance costs in most projects. The maintenance costs on the majority of debts fit into a linear regression model---indicating stable ``interest" rate. In five projects, 12.1% to 27.6% of debts fit into an exponential model, indicating increasing ``interest" rate, which deserve higher priority from architects. The regression models can accurately predict the costs of the majority of (82% to 100%) debts in the next release of a system. By aggregating related ATDs, architects can focus on a small number of cost-effective compound debts, which contain a relatively small number of source files, but account for a large portion of maintenance costs in their projects. With these capabilities, our approach can help architects make informed decisions regarding whether, where, and how to refactor for eliminating ATDs in their systems.},

Though architecture quality is considered very important by the software engineering community, architecture refactoring, given involved high risk and effort, is often avoided by software development teams. In this paper, we empirically explore the properties of architecture smells in the context of the Pareto principle. We investigate the degree of adherence of architecture smell occurrences to the Pareto principle and explore the influence of other related factors i.e., programming language and size of the repositories. To this end, we analyzed 750 Java and 361 C} #  repositories containing more than 50 million lines of code to
	detect seven kinds of architecture smells. We found that approximately
	45% of the Java repositories follow the Pareto principle. Moreover,
	C #{ repositories show significantly higher adherence (66%) to the principle than the repositories written in Java. Our results indicate that the size of the repositories shows a low negative correlation with the Pareto categories. The results imply that software development teams can figure out a few vital components suffering from architecture smells by carrying out the Pareto analysis. It will allow them to optimize their efforts towards making their software architecture quality better},

In this paper, we present a study on the evolution of ASs as well as on how and when they foster system degradation. Thus, we provide valuable insights regarding what ASs are meaningful to assure system quality. To this end, we analyzed the evolution of three types of ASs in 14 open-source systems with a total of 485 versions. We adapted indicators used in previous studies to assess the severity of ASs (e.g., growth, lifetime), and relate ASs to technical debt as another established indicator. Our results indicate that 1) ASs remain mostly stable compared to the code size of a system, 2) certain types of ASs, such as cyclic dependencies, have a greater impact on system degradation, and 3) certain properties determine how much an AS contributes to software degradation. These findings are valuable for practitioners to identify and tackle system degeneration, as well as for researchers to scope new research on managing ASs and technical debt.},

  abstract  = {The recognition of the need for high-quality software architecture is evident from the increasing trend in investigating architectural smells. Detection of architectural smells is paramount because they can seep through to design and implementation stages if left unidentified. Many architectural smells detection techniques and tools are proposed in the literature. The diversity in the detection techniques and tools suggests the need for their collective analysis to identify interesting aspects for practice and open research areas. To fulfill this, in this paper, we unify the knowledge about the detection of architectural smells through a systematic mapping study. We report on the existing detection techniques and tools for architectural smells to identify their limitations. We find there has been limited investigation of some architectural smells (e.g., micro-service smells); many architectural smells are not detected by tools yet; and there are limited empirical validations of techniques and tools. Based on our findings, we suggest several open research problems, including the need to (1) investigate undetected architectural smells (e.g., Java package smells), (2) improve the coverage of architectural smell detection across architecture styles (e.g., service-oriented and cloud), and (3) perform empirical validations of techniques and tools in industry across different languages and project domains.},
